## Voiceover
[Whispered throughout. Close-mic, ASMR-adjacent. The whisper should feel like someone talking to the camera while hiding — urgent, conspiratorial, slightly breathless. Not performative — genuinely tense.]

[0:00] "Watch this."
[pause — 2s]
[0:05] "I hid here last round."
[pause — 3s]
[0:11] "See? It checks."
[pause — 2s]
[0:16] "I used this hallway to escape twice."
[pause — 3s]
[0:22] "Now it patrols it."
[pause — 3s]
[0:28] "It remembers everything you do."
[pause — 2s]
[0:33] "Every. Single. Thing."
[pause — 3s]
[0:38] [silence — logo]

## Visual Direction

### Part 1 — Hiding Spot Memory (0:00-0:14)

- [0:00-0:02] Cold open. First-person POV, player crouched behind a hospital reception desk. The flashlight is off. Text overlay (white, handwritten style): "Watch this." The player peers over the desk edge. Down the corridor, The Patient is visible — tall silhouette, moving slowly, head tilting as it listens. Fear tier: Dread. Heartbeat audio, desaturation, light vignette.

- [0:02-0:05] The Patient approaches the area where the player is hiding. But instead of searching broadly, it diverts — walking directly to an open supply closet across the hall. The closet door is ajar. The entity stops at the closet. Peers inside. Searches it methodically — head sweeping left, right, pausing, listening. Text overlay: "I hid here last round." The implication is clear: the player used that closet in a previous attempt, and the entity remembered.

- [0:05-0:08] The Patient finishes searching the closet. Finds nothing. It backs out. Stands in the corridor for a moment, motionless. Then it turns — and looks directly at the reception desk where the player is hiding. Fear tier spikes to Panic. The player ducks down below the desk edge. Heartbeat intensifies.

- [0:08-0:11] Through a gap in the desk panels, the player watches The Patient approach the desk. It reaches the desk. Leans over it. The player is pressed flat against the floor. The entity's breathing is audible — wet, labored, close. It lingers for three agonizing seconds. Then it moves on, continuing down the corridor. Fear tier drops to Dread. Text overlay: "See? It checks."

- [0:11-0:14] The player exhales (audible relief breath). Stands up cautiously. Looks toward the closet the entity just searched, then back to where it departed. Text overlay: "It remembers where you've been." Brief pause. Transition — hard cut with a single-frame flash of static.

### Part 2 — Route Memory (0:14-0:27)

- [0:14-0:16] New sequence. Text overlay (bold, center screen): "ROUTE MEMORY" with a line underneath. Fades after 1.5s. First-person POV — the player is in a different section of the hospital, at the intersection of two corridors. Text overlay: "I used this hallway to escape twice."

- [0:16-0:19] The player peeks around the corner into the hallway they previously used as an escape route. The hallway is empty — but something is different. The ambient lighting is slightly dimmer. A faint audio cue (low-frequency hum) suggests the entity is nearby but not visible. The player waits.

- [0:19-0:22] The Patient appears at the far end of the escape hallway. It's not chasing. It's patrolling. Walking the corridor slowly, deliberately, back and forth. It has incorporated this route into its patrol path because the player used it repeatedly. The entity's head scans left and right as it walks — checking room entrances along the route. Text overlay: "Now it patrols it."

- [0:22-0:25] The player pulls back from the corner. Looks the other direction — the alternate route. It's clear, but darker, longer, and passes through a room the player hasn't explored. The entity has forced the player to change strategies. Fear tier at Dread, holding steady. Text overlay: "It remembers everything you do."

- [0:25-0:27] The player takes the alternate route. As they enter the unexplored room, something skitters in the darkness (audio only — no visual confirmation). The player freezes. The implication: new routes carry new risks. Hard cut.

### Part 3 — The Cumulative Effect (0:27-0:38)

- [0:27-0:30] Rapid montage — 4 quick cuts (0.75s each), showing the entity adapting:
  1. Entity checking under a bed the player hid under previously — it flips the mattress.
  2. Entity standing guard at a generator the player needs to activate — it learned the objective.
  3. Entity approaching a vent the player crawled through — it waits at the exit.
  4. Entity reversing direction mid-patrol to double back — it heard the player's footsteps and is cutting off the retreat.

  Text overlay across the montage: "Every. Single. Thing."

- [0:30-0:35] Final shot. Wide angle — the player stands in a room. Every previous hiding spot in view (closet, desk, bed, vent) has been compromised. The entity knows them all. The player looks around — nowhere is safe anymore. The fear tier sits at Panic even though the entity isn't visible on screen — the audio tells you it's close, circling, hunting. The visual degradation (heavy desaturation, vignette, faint shake) reinforces the helplessness.

- [0:35-0:38] The player turns to face the camera (breaking the first-person POV for the first and only time — the character model faces the viewer). Behind them, deep in the unfocused background, The Patient steps into frame. The player doesn't see it. The viewer does. Freeze frame. Fear tier: Proximity (full effects visible on the frozen frame). Hold for 1 second.

- [0:38-0:40] Hard cut to black. The Origin logo fades in. Below: "It adapts. It learns. It hunts." Below that: "Free on Roblox." End card. 2-second hold.

## Audio Notes

- **0:00-0:14 (Hiding Spot)**: Tense sustained string note (single cello, harmonics). Player breathing (controlled, trying to be quiet). Entity footsteps (slow, heavy, tile surface). Entity breathing SFX (close when near desk — binaural panning for headphone users, entity moves from left to right channel). Heartbeat audio at Dread/Panic levels. When entity searches the closet: door creak, hands on shelves, objects shifting.
- **0:14-0:16 (Transition)**: Static burst SFX on cut. Brief silence. "ROUTE MEMORY" text has a soft UI chime (data/system-like).
- **0:16-0:22 (Route Patrol)**: Lower ambient tension. Entity footsteps echoing down the hallway (reverb suggests distance). The patrol has a rhythm — step, step, pause, scan, step, step. This rhythm is unsettling because it feels methodical, intelligent.
- **0:22-0:27 (Alternate Route)**: Footsteps on different surface (carpet or grating — signaling new territory). The skittering sound in the dark room: brief, sharp, ambiguous (could be debris, could be something else). Player's sharp inhale on the freeze.
- **0:27-0:30 (Montage)**: Percussive hits synced to each cut. Each hit slightly louder than the last (escalation). Bed flip: mattress thud + springs. Generator: electrical hum. Vent: metallic crawling sound. Direction reversal: footstep pattern interruption (stop, pivot, resume).
- **0:30-0:35 (Nowhere Safe)**: All ambient audio layers stacked at moderate volume — creating a wall of unease. Heartbeat at 110 BPM. Whisper layer at medium coherence. No music — just the system's fear audio doing its job.
- **0:35-0:38 (Freeze Frame)**: All audio cuts to silence on the freeze except a single, sustained low tone (organ-like, rumbling). 2 seconds. Then logo sound.
- **0:38-0:40 (End Card)**: Sub-bass swell. Single reversed piano note. Fade to silence.

## Fear Timeline

| 0:35-0:38 | Proximity (freeze) | Entity directly behind player |

## Render Notes

- **Text overlays**: White, handwritten/brush font, positioned in the upper third of the 9:16 frame. Slight animation — not static text, but a gentle floating/breathing motion. Drop shadow for legibility against dark backgrounds.
- **Entity behavior clarity**: Each adaptive behavior (checking old hiding spot, patrolling escape route, guarding objective, waiting at vent exit) must be clearly readable in the fast montage cuts. Use slight slow-motion (75% speed) if needed to ensure the action reads.
- **The final freeze frame**: This is the money shot. The background entity must be visible but not obvious — it should take the viewer a moment to notice. Depth-of-field blur on the background, but the entity's silhouette is distinct enough to identify once you see it. This moment should generate "wait, look behind you" comments.
- **"ROUTE MEMORY" interstitial**: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (Inter or similar). The label should feel like a system diagnostic or game mechanic tooltip — clinical, not horror-styled. This contrast (clinical label over horror footage) reinforces the "this is a system" messaging.
- **Pacing**: The first half (hiding spot) is slow and tense. The second half (route memory + montage) accelerates. The final freeze frame brings everything to a dead stop. This pacing curve — slow, medium, fast, STOP — maximizes impact.
- **CTA text**: "It adapts. It learns. It hunts." should appear one phrase at a time (fade in sequentially) below the logo. Period after each phrase for rhythm.
- **Thumbnail**: The freeze frame from 0:35 — player facing camera, entity in background. Text overlay: "This AI learns your habits" in bold white.
