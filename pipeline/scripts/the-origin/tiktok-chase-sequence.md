## Visual Direction

- [0:00-0:04] Cold open. First-person POV walking down a dark hospital corridor. Flickering fluorescent lights. Fear tier: Unease. Slight desaturation beginning. Text overlay fades in: "They told us the hospital was empty." (white, handwritten font, slight tremor animation).
- [0:04-0:07] Player turns a corner. A wheelchair sits in the middle of the hallway, slowly rocking. Fear tier escalates to Dread. Heartbeat audio begins. Vignette creeps in. VO text: "They were wrong."
- [0:07-0:12] Player's flashlight catches something at the far end of the corridor — a tall, gaunt silhouette. The Patient. Standing motionless. Electronics on the wall (a heart monitor mounted outside a room) flatline with a sharp tone. Fear tier: Panic. Screen desaturates further. Pulse vignette intensifies.
- [0:12-0:15] Player freezes. Camera holds steady on the entity. VO whisper: "Don't. Move." The Patient's head tilts slowly, listening. Silence except for the player's heartbeat audio.
- [0:15-0:19] The Patient takes one step forward. Then another. Accelerating. Fear tier: Proximity. Full visual degradation — heavy vignette, screen shake, chromatic aberration, whisper audio layers stack.
- [0:19-0:21] Smash cut — player spins and sprints. Camera bobs violently. Hallway lights explode as The Patient passes them. Loud chase music sting.
- [0:21-0:25] Player rounds a corner, sees an open locker. Dives inside. Screen goes nearly black — only thin slits of light through the locker vents. Heavy breathing audio. Fear tier holds at Proximity.
- [0:25-0:27] Through the locker slats: The Patient's feet shuffle past. Slow. Deliberate. A long, rattling exhale from the entity. Fear tier drops to Panic, then Dread.
- [0:27-0:28] Silence. Player's breathing steadies. VO whisper: "It's still out there."
- [0:28-0:30] Hard cut to black. The Origin logo fades in (white on black, slight glitch animation). Below: "Free on Roblox." Beat. End card.

## Audio Notes

- **0:00-0:07**: Low ambient drone (hospital ambience — distant dripping, faint electrical hum). Soft, unsettling string pad underneath.
- **0:07-0:12**: Heart monitor flatline tone (sharp, piercing, then cuts to silence). Heartbeat audio begins (60 BPM, gradually accelerating to 120 BPM by 0:19).
- **0:12-0:15**: Near-silence. Only heartbeat and faint whisper layer (unintelligible, layered voices).
- **0:15-0:19**: Entity footstep SFX — wet, heavy impacts on tile. Each step slightly louder.
- **0:19-0:21**: Chase sting — sudden orchestral hit + industrial percussion. Fluorescent light shatter SFX (glass + electrical pop).
- **0:21-0:25**: Muffled audio inside locker. Player breathing (close-mic, panicked). Locker metal creak on entry.
- **0:25-0:27**: Entity breathing SFX through locker — deep, labored, inhuman rattling exhale. Feet shuffling on tile.
- **0:27-0:30**: Silence. Logo sound: low sub-bass rumble + single reversed piano note.

## Fear Timeline

| Timestamp | Fear Tier | Effects Active |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 0:00-0:04 | Safe → Unease | Slight desaturation begins |
| 0:04-0:07 | Unease → Dread | Heartbeat audio, vignette, desaturation increases |
| 0:07-0:15 | Dread → Panic | Heavy vignette, pulse effect, whisper layers |
| 0:15-0:25 | Panic → Proximity | Full degradation — screen shake, chromatic aberration, all layers stacked |
| 0:25-0:27 | Proximity → Dread | Effects recede as entity passes |
| 0:27-0:30 | Dread (holding) | Lingering vignette, faint heartbeat |

## Render Notes

- Record at 60fps, render at 30fps for slight motion blur on chase sequence.
- Flashlight should be the primary light source — no ambient fill light in corridors.
- The Patient model should only be partially visible — silhouette and shape, never a clear full reveal.
- Locker interior POV: Use narrow letterbox crop (slat-shaped) overlaid on the 9:16 frame.
- Logo end card: 2-second hold minimum. Glitch effect on logo is a 3-frame displacement with RGB channel split.
- Add thin white captions for all VO (centered bottom third, no background box, slight drop shadow).
