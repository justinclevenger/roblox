## Voiceover
[PA announcement voice — female, clinical, distorted through a hospital intercom speaker. Heavy reverb, slight clipping, as if recorded from a physical speaker in a room. Intermittent static bursts interrupt the announcement.]

[0:03] "Attention all staff. Ward B is now under— [static burst, 0.5s] —lockdown."
[0:08] "Patient thirty-one has been— [static, garbled audio, 0.3s] —reclassified."
[0:12] "Do not— [long static burst, 1s] —make direct eye contact."
[0:16] "Containment protocol Ori— [signal cuts entirely]"

## Visual Direction

- [0:00-0:02] Black screen. A loading indicator appears — not a modern spinner, but an old terminal cursor blinking. Then a document renders in, line by line, as if being pulled from a corrupted database. The screen has a slight green-on-black CRT phosphor aesthetic (think old hospital records terminal).

- [0:02-0:05] The document stabilizes. It's a patient intake form — visible fields:

  ```
  ST. MAREN'S HOSPITAL — PSYCHIATRIC DIVISION
  WARD B — BASEMENT LEVEL
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  PATIENT ID:     031
  NAME:           [REDACTED — BLACK BAR]
  DOB:            [REDACTED — BLACK BAR]
  ADMIT DATE:     09/12/1987
  ATTENDING:      Dr. [REDACTED] / Dr. Emil Voss
  CLASSIFICATION: ████████ → RECLASSIFIED: SEE ADDENDUM
  STATUS:         ███ ACTIVE ███
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ```

  The PA announcement begins playing over this. Glitch artifacts flicker across redacted sections — for single frames, text is briefly visible beneath the black bars but too fast to read naturally (requires pause/frame-advance: the name reads "MAREN ELISE ████" and the DOB reads "██/██/195█").

- [0:05-0:09] The document scrolls down (as if someone is navigating the terminal). New section appears:

  ```
  CLINICAL NOTES — DR. VOSS
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  09/14/1987: Patient unresponsive to standard evaluation.
              Refuses to acknowledge own name. Refers to
              self only as "the first."
  09/19/1987: [REDACTED — 3 LINES]
  09/22/1987: Incident report filed. See Attachment C.
              Two orderlies hospitalized. Patient found
              in [REDACTED] position. No recollection of
              event. Recommended reclassification to ████.
  10/01/1987: Ward B sealed by order of [REDACTED].
              All 31 patients remanded to permanent hold.
              Outside communication suspended.
  10/03/1987: [FINAL ENTRY]
              the door is open now. it was always open.
              we just couldn't see it before.
              god forgive us. we made it worse.
  ```

  The final entry (10/03/1987) is not formatted like the others — it's lowercase, no clinical structure, as if someone typed it in a panic. The text color shifts from green to a sickly amber on this entry. The PA audio continues overhead, increasingly garbled.

- [0:09-0:13] The screen glitches hard — full corruption. The document tears apart horizontally. Through the corruption, a new image assembles: a hand-drawn diagram (as if sketched by a patient on institutional paper). It shows concentric circles with symbols at each ring — the innermost circle is labeled "THE ORIGIN" in shaky handwriting. Lines radiate outward to labels that are partially legible: "THE PATIENT," "THE CRAWLERS," "THE [smudged]," "THE WATCHERS," "THE [torn]." The drawing looks like it was scanned from physical paper — yellowed, creased, with brown stains (coffee or something else).

- [0:13-0:16] The diagram destabilizes. The concentric circles begin rotating in opposite directions (inner clockwise, outer counter-clockwise). The center point — "THE ORIGIN" — pulses red. A low-frequency vibration shakes the entire frame. The PA audio cuts out with a loud pop. Silence.

- [0:16-0:18] Black screen. A single line of text types out, character by character, in white monospaced font: "CONTAINMENT STATUS: FAILED." The word "FAILED" glitches between red and white. A cursor blinks after the final period.

- [0:18-0:20] The text is replaced by the game title: "THE ORIGIN" — same font and style as the patient's drawing label (shaky, hand-rendered). Below, in clean modern font: "Uncover the truth." Below that, smaller: "Free on Roblox." End card with faint static overlay. Hold.

## Audio Notes

- **0:00-0:02**: CRT power-on hum. Terminal rendering sounds — rapid clicking/ticking as text appears, like a dot-matrix printer or teletype. Faint electrical buzz.
- **0:02-0:09**: PA announcement (primary audio — see VO section). Beneath the PA, a persistent low ambient drone (hospital HVAC / fluorescent ballast). Terminal scrolling has a soft mechanical sound. Redaction glitches have a brief digital artifact sound (0.1s each).
- **0:09-0:13**: Heavy glitch audio — digital tearing, buffer overflow sounds (rapid-fire clicks and pops). The diagram appearance is accompanied by a sound like paper being unfolded, mixed with a subtle wet sound (unsettling, organic). As the circles rotate, a low-frequency oscillation (15-25Hz — felt more than heard, may not reproduce on phone speakers but adds unease on headphones).
- **0:13-0:16**: PA pop-out (speaker feedback squeal, 0.2s, then silence). The red pulse from "THE ORIGIN" center has a heartbeat-like thud (single, deep, reverberant).
- **0:16-0:18**: Near-silence. Typing sounds (mechanical keyboard, deliberate pace). The "FAILED" glitch has a faint electrical arc sound.
- **0:18-0:20**: Low sub-bass swell under title. Fades to silence. No logo sting — the ARG aesthetic demands restraint.

## Fear Timeline

N/A — This is not gameplay footage. No fear system overlay. The dread is purely atmospheric and narrative.

## Render Notes

- **Corruption level**: High. This piece should look like it was pulled from a dying hard drive. Glitch artifacts should be persistent but not overwhelming — the text must remain readable on first viewing (except for the intentionally hidden sub-frame content).
- **Sub-frame hidden content**: The name beneath the redaction bar ("MAREN ELISE ████") appears for exactly 2 frames at 0:04. The DOB fragment appears for 1 frame at 0:04.5. These are designed for the community to discover through frame-by-frame analysis and generate lore discussion. "MAREN" deliberately echoes the hospital name — this is an intentional mystery seed.
- **The patient diagram**: Should look authentically hand-drawn — uneven lines, pressure variation, slightly shaky text. The paper texture should include institutional grid lines (like graph paper from a hospital supply). The brown stains should be ambiguous.
- **Color palette**: Green CRT phosphor (#33FF33 on black) for the terminal. Amber (#FFAA00) for the final corrupted entry. Red (#FF0000) for "FAILED" and the Origin pulse. Otherwise monochrome.
- **Distribution strategy**: Post with no caption or a single cryptic caption ("031"). Do not use the game's official branding or account initially. Respond to comments with in-character fragments ("the door is open now," "reclassified," "ward B"). Link to game only after 48 hours or after sufficient speculation builds.
- **Series potential**: This is designed as the first of a series. Future ARG clips could include: security camera footage from Ward B, Dr. Voss's audio recordings, incident report Attachment C, and the containment protocol document (cut off at "Ori—" in this clip — full version revealed later).
- **Accessibility**: Despite the glitch aesthetic, ensure the PA audio is clear enough to understand on first listen. The corrupted words should be obvious interruptions, not confusing edits. Add auto-captions with [STATIC] and [SIGNAL LOST] markers.
