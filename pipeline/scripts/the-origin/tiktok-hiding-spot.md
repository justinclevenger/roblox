## Voiceover
[No traditional VO — text overlays only, with one whispered line at the end]

[0:18] [whispered, close-mic] "It learns."

## Visual Direction

- [0:00-0:02] Cold open. Text overlay (bold white, center screen): "The AI in this game adapts to you." Quick fade. First-person POV — player running through hospital ward, fear tier at Dread. Heartbeat audio. Frantic camera movement.
- [0:02-0:05] Player reaches a row of lockers. Opens one, dives inside. Interior POV — slats of light, heavy breathing. Text overlay (top): "Round 1."
- [0:05-0:08] Through locker slats: The Patient shuffles into view. Pauses. Head tilts, listening. Long beat. Then it turns and walks away, disappearing around a corner. Fear tier drops from Panic to Dread to Safe.
- [0:08-0:09] Player opens locker, steps out. Brief moment of relief. Breathing steadies.
- [0:09-0:10] Hard cut — VHS-style glitch transition. Text overlay: "3 rounds later..." (typewriter animation, slightly corrupted font).
- [0:10-0:13] Same scenario. Player sprinting through the same ward, same camera urgency. Fear tier at Panic. Player reaches the same row of lockers, dives into the same locker. Interior POV again.
- [0:13-0:16] Through locker slats: The Patient enters the corridor. But this time it doesn't search. It walks directly to the locker. No hesitation. No scanning. It knows.
- [0:16-0:18] The Patient's face fills the locker slats. A hand reaches for the door. The locker rips open — hard cut to red flash (death screen). Fear tier: Proximity (full degradation) into death.
- [0:18-0:20] Black screen. Whispered VO: "It learns." Text overlay fades in matching the whisper. Hold for 2 seconds.
- [0:20-0:23] Quick montage — 3 fast cuts (0.5s each):
  1. Entity checking under a desk the player previously hid under.
  2. Entity patrolling a corridor the player used as an escape route.
  3. Entity waiting around a corner the player always turns.
- [0:23-0:25] The Origin logo. Glitch in. Below: "Free on Roblox." End card.

## Audio Notes

- **0:00-0:02**: Tense staccato strings. Running footstep SFX on tile.
- **0:02-0:05**: Locker slam SFX (metal clang). Muffled interior ambience. Heavy breathing.
- **0:05-0:08**: Entity footsteps (slow, heavy). Breathing from entity (distant, labored). Silence as it leaves — audio relief swell (soft pad resolving down).
- **0:08-0:09**: Brief calm — ambient hospital drone only.
- **0:09-0:10**: Glitch transition SFX — digital corruption burst (0.3s).
- **0:10-0:13**: Identical audio to 0:02-0:05 but with higher-pitched string tension underneath. Same locker slam.
- **0:13-0:16**: Entity footsteps — faster, more purposeful. No searching sounds. Direct path. Heartbeat audio accelerates rapidly.
- **0:16-0:18**: Locker rip-open SFX (violent metal screech). Death sting — low brass hit + reversed scream. Red flash audio (distorted bass pulse).
- **0:18-0:20**: Silence. Whisper VO only. Faint ringing tone (tinnitus effect).
- **0:20-0:23**: Rapid percussion hits synced to each cut. Stinger chords. Entity movement SFX.
- **0:23-0:25**: Logo sound — sub-bass rumble + single reversed piano note (matching brand audio).

## Fear Timeline

| Timestamp | Fear Tier | Effects Active |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 0:00-0:02 | Dread | Heartbeat, desaturation, vignette |
| 0:02-0:05 | Dread → Panic | Hiding — heavy vignette, whisper layer |
| 0:05-0:08 | Panic → Safe | Effects recede as entity departs |
| 0:08-0:09 | Safe | Clean visuals, normal color |
| 0:10-0:13 | Panic | Immediate high fear — skipping Unease/Dread buildup |
| 0:13-0:16 | Panic → Proximity | Full degradation as entity approaches directly |
| 0:16-0:18 | Proximity → Death | Screen shake, chromatic aberration, red flash |

## Render Notes

- The two locker sequences should use identical camera angles and framing to emphasize the behavioral difference.
- "Round 1" and "3 rounds later..." text overlays use a monospaced font (Courier or similar) to suggest data/system logging.
- The death screen red flash should be exactly 3 frames at full opacity, then hard cut to black.
- The quick montage cuts (0:20-0:23) use a slight zoom punch-in on each cut for impact.
- Entity's direct approach in the second sequence should feel unnervingly purposeful — no head tilting, no searching animations. Straight-line pathfinding to the locker.
- Captions for whispered VO at 0:18: centered, white, no box, slight fade-in synced to audio.
