## Voiceover

## Visual Direction

### Act 1 — Classified (0:00-0:10)
- [0:00-0:03] Black screen. White text fades in, typewriter-style: "CLASSIFIED — ST. MAREN'S HOSPITAL — BASEMENT WARD B" with redacted black bars over portions. A classification stamp: "[LEVEL 5 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]". Faint static hiss.
- [0:03-0:06] Text fades. New line: "PROJECT ORIGIN — CONTAINMENT STATUS: FAILED" — the word "FAILED" glitches red. Hard cut to black.
- [0:06-0:10] Slow push-in on a hospital exterior at night. Rain. Broken windows on the upper floors. One window on the basement level emits a faint, pulsing red light. VO begins.

### Act 2 — The Descent (0:10-0:22)
- [0:10-0:12] Interior — hospital reception. Overturned wheelchairs, papers scattered. Player's flashlight sweeps across. A phone is ringing endlessly. VO: "Thirty-one patients entered."
- [0:12-0:15] Quick cuts (1s each): patient room with restraints on the bed, a wall covered in tally marks, a medical chart with "PATIENT 31" circled in red. VO: "None were discharged."
- [0:15-0:18] First entity reveal — The Patient. Seen from behind, standing at the end of a corridor. Lights flicker and die as the camera pushes in. It turns its head slightly. Cut before full reveal.
- [0:18-0:22] Transition — camera falls through the floor (impossible geometry, dreamlike). Descending. Brief flashes of each environment stacked vertically: hospital floor tiles → subway tunnel grating → research station metal → forest floor → catacomb stone. VO: "Something down there didn't die."

### Act 3 — The Entities (0:22-0:42)
- [0:22-0:25] **Subway** — The Crawlers. Overhead security camera angle. A player runs through a train car. Behind them, three figures scramble across the ceiling, moving in coordinated formation. One drops down behind the player. Cut on impact.
- [0:25-0:28] **Research Station** — The Mimic. Two players in a lab. One turns to the other: "Did you pick up the keycard?" The other player says nothing. Camera slowly zooms in — something is wrong with their face. The real second player runs in from behind: "I've been in the other room the whole—" Cut to black.
- [0:28-0:32] **Forest** — The Watchers. Wide shot of a moonlit clearing. Seven pale figures standing motionless among the trees, facing the camera. Player turns away for one second. When they look back — the figures are 20 feet closer. Player blinks. Closer again. They're everywhere now. VO: "It learned."
- [0:32-0:35] **Catacombs** — The Origin. No clear visual — just a wound in the air, a tear in the geometry of the space. Light bends wrong around it. The walls bleed. Players run past ancient symbols on the walls. VO: "It spread."
- [0:35-0:38] Montage — rapid cuts synced to percussion: entity lunging, player slamming a door, generator powering up (lights flooding on), a player getting dragged into darkness, a heart icon cracking (life lost). VO: "It remembered."
- [0:38-0:42] Slow motion — a player crouched behind a desk, holding breath. The entity's shadow passes across the wall above them. Fear tier at Proximity — full visual degradation visible. The player's screen is nearly monochrome, shaking, vignette closing in.

### Act 4 — Survival (0:42-0:52)
- [0:42-0:46] Gameplay montage — cooperative moments: one player distracting an entity while another activates a generator. A player reviving a downed teammate with the 30-second timer visible. Players communicating via flashlight signals in the dark. VO: "You cannot fight it."
- [0:46-0:49] Hard contrast — solo player, alone, deep in the catacombs. Two paths ahead. The Seal glows at the end of one. The destruction point at the end of the other. VO: "You can only survive it."
- [0:49-0:52] The player reaches toward the Seal. Flash of white. Hard cut to black.

### Act 5 — Title (0:52-0:60)
- [0:52-0:55] Black screen. 3 seconds of silence. Then — a single heartbeat. On the beat, the title appears: "THE ORIGIN" in large white text, slightly unstable (micro-tremor animation). A crack runs through the letter "O" revealing red beneath.
- [0:55-0:57] Beneath the title, text fades in: "5 Levels. No Weapons. It Adapts."
- [0:57-0:58] Below that: "1-4 Players"
- [0:58-0:60] Final line fades in: "Free on Roblox." Roblox logo lockup (small, bottom right). The title's crack widens slightly. End card hold.

## Audio Notes

### Music
- **0:00-0:10**: Near-silence. Faint static hiss. A single sustained low cello note, barely audible, building imperceptibly.
- **0:10-0:22**: Sparse piano — isolated minor key notes with long decay. Reverb-heavy. The cello drone continues beneath, growing.
- **0:22-0:35**: Strings enter — dissonant, Penderecki-influenced cluster chords. Builds with each entity reveal. Percussion begins at 0:30 — deep taiko-style hits.
- **0:35-0:42**: Full orchestral intensity. Rapid string ostinato. Percussion doubles tempo. Industrial texture (metallic scraping, distorted impacts).
- **0:42-0:49**: Music pulls back to breathing room. Returns to solo cello + piano. But now the cello is distorted, wrong — played with too much pressure, almost breaking.
- **0:49-0:52**: Silence. Just the sound of breathing.
- **0:52-0:60**: Single heartbeat hit. Sub-bass swell under title. Fades to nothing.

### SFX
- Entity-specific sounds at each reveal (flatline for The Patient, skittering for Crawlers, uncanny-valley speech for Mimic, stone scraping for Watchers, reality-tearing for The Origin).
- Generator power-up sequence: mechanical churn → electrical hum → lights slamming on.
- Heart crack SFX: ceramic/glass fracture sound.
- Environmental: rain, dripping, electrical buzzing, distant screams (barely audible, mixed low).

## Fear Timeline

| Timestamp | Fear Tier | Effects Active |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 0:00-0:10 | N/A | Clean cinematics, no fear overlay |
| 0:10-0:18 | Unease → Dread | Subtle desaturation, light vignette |
| 0:18-0:22 | Dread | Transition sequence — stylized, not gameplay fear |
| 0:22-0:35 | Panic (per entity) | Each entity segment shows gameplay-accurate fear effects |
| 0:35-0:42 | Proximity | Full degradation shown in slow-motion hiding shot |
| 0:42-0:52 | Dread → Safe | Effects recede during cooperative gameplay |
| 0:52-0:60 | N/A | Clean title card |

## Render Notes

- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 widescreen. Consider 2.39:1 letterbox for cinematic feel (thin black bars top and bottom).
- **Color grade**: Desaturated cold tones (teal shadows, warm highlights only from fire/emergency lighting). Each level has a distinct color accent:
  - Hospital: sickly green fluorescent
  - Subway: amber emergency lighting
  - Research Station: sterile blue-white
  - Forest: silver moonlight
  - Catacombs: deep red from the Seal
- **Entity reveals**: Never show a full, clear, well-lit shot of any entity. Silhouettes, partial glimpses, motion blur, shadow. The audience should feel like they almost saw it.
- **Text overlays**: Classified documents use a monospaced font (Courier) with scan-line overlay. Title card uses a custom serif with the crack effect.
- **Frame rate**: Capture at 60fps. Render final at 24fps for cinematic motion cadence. Slow-motion sequences at 0:38-0:42 rendered at 12fps for a dreamlike, stuttery quality.
- **Sound mix**: VO should sit clearly above music at all times. Entity SFX should be mixed to feel uncomfortably close (binaural positioning if possible). Final mix to streaming loudness standards (-14 LUFS).
- **End card**: Minimum 3-second hold on title. Include clickable overlay zone for Roblox game link (platform-dependent).
- **Versions**: Export a 9:16 vertical cut for TikTok/Shorts (re-frame key moments, same audio, 45s max) as a secondary deliverable.
