## Voiceover
[no traditional voiceover — the death screens ARE the voiceover]

## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:01] Title card: "Drawing is hard." scrawled in wobbly handwriting on a sketch-paper background. Quick beat.
- [0:01-0:04] DEATH 1 — THE BRIDGE COLLAPSE. Player confidently draws a long, thin bridge across a gap. Selects Stone material. The bridge materializes — it is way too heavy for its own span. It snaps in the middle immediately. Player plummets. Quick cut to death screen: "YOU FELL" in dripping ink letters. Ink splatter fills the screen. Screen shakes. The 1.5-second jumpscare holds just long enough to register. Player respawns at the checkpoint.
- [0:04-0:07] DEATH 2 — THE RUNAWAY BALLOON. Player draws a platform, selects Balloon material. Steps onto it. The platform immediately starts rising uncontrollably. Player panics (character animation shows frantic arm-waving). Platform floats into a ceiling of spikes. Pop. Player falls. Death screen: "DRAW BETTER" in shaky scrawled text. Ink splatter. Screen shake. Quick respawn.
- [0:07-0:10] DEATH 3 — THE ICE SLIDE. Player draws a ramp, selects Ice material. Steps onto it and instantly slides off the far edge at high speed, rocketing off a cliff. The character ragdolls through the air. Death screen: "NOT GOOD ENOUGH" with extra-aggressive ink splatter. Quick respawn.
- [0:10-0:13] DEATH 4 — THE VOID MISTAKE. The Void zone. Player carefully draws a floor tile. Steps onto it. Draws another tile ahead. Steps forward. Draws a third tile — but accidentally leaves a tiny gap. Player walks confidently forward and drops through the gap into infinite darkness. A long, slow fall. Death screen: "THE VOID CLAIMS ALL" in ominous glowing text against pure black. The most dramatic death screen of the bunch.
- [0:13-0:16] DEATH 5 — THE METAL LIGHTNING ROD. Storm Peaks zone. Player draws a tall metal pole to climb. Lightning strikes it immediately. Electricity conducts through the metal, zapping the player. Death screen: "SHOCKING" with electric-spark effects mixed into the ink splatter. Quick respawn.
- [0:16-0:18] RAPID DEATH MONTAGE. Three deaths in two seconds — just the death screens back-to-back-to-back: "YOU FELL" / "DRAW BETTER" / "THE VOID CLAIMS ALL" — rapid cuts with screen shake on each.
- [0:18-0:20] Final shot: Player respawns, pauses, opens the canvas, and starts drawing again with determination. Text overlay: "Try again." Draw to Escape logo. "Play Free on Roblox."

## Audio Notes
- Music: A comedic, upbeat track that plays through the whole video. Something that contrasts with the deaths — bouncy and lighthearted while terrible things happen. Think "Yakety Sax" energy but more modern — a playful electronic track with a fast tempo.
- SFX: Each death gets a distinct comedic sound:
  - Bridge collapse: Dramatic crack + sad trombone descending
  - Balloon pop: Squeaky rise + loud POP + whistling fall
  - Ice slide: Cartoon slip sound + ascending "wheeeee" + thud
  - Void gap: Complete silence during the fall, then a distant "plink" when the death screen hits
  - Lightning: Electric zap + sizzle + comedy sting
- Death screen sounds: Each death screen has a consistent "SPLAT" ink impact sound plus a quick bass rumble for the screen shake. The Void death screen is the exception — it gets a low, ominous drone instead.
- The rapid montage at [0:16] plays the splat sounds in quick succession like a drumroll.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. Gameplay captured with the camera following the player's demise each time.
- Pacing is everything here — each death should be quick setup, quick payoff. No lingering. The comedy comes from the speed and repetition.
- The death screens are the game's actual death screens — do not recreate or modify them. Capture them natively.
- Speed: Normal speed for the death moments. The respawn can be cut (jump cut from death screen to player back at checkpoint).
- Color grade: Match each zone's native palette. The death screens provide their own visual treatment.
- The final "Try again" text should feel earned — a beat of genuine determination after the comedy.
- No text overlays during gameplay except the final shot. Let the death screens do the talking.
