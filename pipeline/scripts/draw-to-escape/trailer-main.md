## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:

**Act 1 — The Spark [0:00-0:17]**
- [0:00-0:03] COLD OPEN. Extreme close-up on a blank white page. A pencil tip touches the paper. A single line is drawn slowly — the graphite scratching sound is crisp and intimate. The line curves gently.
- [0:03-0:05] The camera pulls back slightly. The drawn line begins to glow. It trembles, then lifts off the page, rotating in 3D space. The flat 2D sketch becomes a volumetric 3D object — a simple wooden plank. Particle effects swirl around it like pencil shavings caught in light.
- [0:05-0:09] Wider shot reveals the Sketch Fields. The plank lands across a gap with a satisfying thud. A player character (bright, stylized, approachable) steps onto it cautiously, then confidently walks across. The camera sweeps to show the cheerful meadow environment — hand-drawn clouds, doodle flowers, a warm sun.
- [0:09-0:12] Quick sequence of the core mechanic shown three times in rapid succession: (1) Player draws a ramp — camera follows them launching upward. (2) Player draws a floating balloon platform — camera shows them rising above the level. (3) Player draws a stone weight to press a switch — camera follows the weight dropping onto the pressure plate with a heavy impact.
- [0:12-0:14] A beat of stillness. The player stands at the edge of a massive gap. Below: lava. The camera slowly pans across the danger.
- [0:14-0:17] Canvas opens. Player draws a long bridge. It materializes as wood — the camera tracks alongside the bridge as it forms plank by plank. Player sprints across. Close-up on their feet pounding the wood. Safe landing on the other side. The bridge behind them catches fire from the lava heat. The player glances back.

**Act 2 — The Journey [0:17-0:38]**
- [0:17-0:20] CREATIVE SOLUTIONS MONTAGE. Same puzzle — a tall wall. Three different players, three solutions shown in rapid split-screen: Player A draws stairs (simple), Player B draws a catapult (launches over), Player C draws a balloon and rides it up. All three land on the other side simultaneously.
- [0:20-0:23] THE PAPER FOREST. Wide shot of paper trees swaying. Player draws a hang glider and soars between paper-craft canopies. Camera tracks from below, looking up through translucent paper leaves catching sunlight.
- [0:23-0:25] THE CRAYON CAVERNS. Darkness. A neon drawing ignites, revealing a vast cavern of crayon-scrawled walls. The camera pulls back through a tunnel of color.
- [0:25-0:27] THE WATERCOLOR WETLANDS. Dreamy pastel lake. Player floats on a drawn wooden boat. A massive watercolor fish breaches the surface, splashing soft paint-like water.
- [0:27-0:29] THE INK RUINS. Player sprints across crumbling ink-floor tiles, drawing replacement platforms in real time as the ground vanishes beneath them. Frantic pacing.
- [0:29-0:31] THE NEON GRID. Gravity flip. Player runs on the ceiling, draws a metal shield, deflects a laser beam that ricochets across the wireframe landscape.
- [0:31-0:33] THE STORM PEAKS. Lightning strikes. Player draws a rubber dome. Electricity arcs around it but doesn't penetrate. They emerge unscathed into howling wind.
- [0:33-0:35] MULTIPLAYER MOMENT. Wide shot showing 4-5 players in the same level. One player's expired drawing remains as a static feature in the environment. Another player uses it as a stepping stone. Drawings from different players in different materials create a colorful, chaotic landscape. A quick moment of collaborative problem-solving — two players draw different pieces of a bridge that connect in the middle.
- [0:35-0:38] THE LIVING CANVAS. A player's drawing of a bird comes alive and attacks. Reality warps — walls twist, colors shift. The player draws a cage around the hostile creation. The music shifts to something dissonant and eerie.

**Act 3 — The Climax [0:38-0:55]**
- [0:38-0:41] Cut to black. A single breath. Then — THE VOID. The player stands on nothing. Absolute emptiness. They look down. Nothing. Look up. Nothing. They draw a single floor tile beneath their feet. It glows softly in the darkness.
- [0:41-0:43] Time-lapse sequence: the player builds an entire path through the Void, drawing floor, walls, bridges, platforms. The camera pulls back to reveal an intricate glowing structure suspended in infinite blackness — beautiful and lonely.
- [0:43-0:47] THE CLIFF. Massive vertical shot — camera tilts from the base of a towering structure to its impossibly distant summit. The player begins climbing, drawing platforms, ladders, hooks in rapid succession. Every material type is visible — wood, stone, balloon, metal, neon — a rainbow of drawn objects clinging to the cliffside.
- [0:47-0:50] Near the summit. The player draws a balloon to make the final leap. They soar upward. The camera rotates around them as they rise. Below, the entire journey is visible — all ten zones stretching out beneath, a tapestry of everything they drew to get here.
- [0:50-0:53] The player lands on the summit. Golden light washes over them. Three stars burst outward. The camera slowly orbits the character as they stand atop the world.
- [0:53-0:55] Cut to the drawing canvas one final time. A pencil draws the game's logo — "Draw to Escape" — the same way the journey began, with a single line.

**Endcard [0:55-1:00]**
- [0:55-0:58] The logo fills with color and dimension, transforming from a flat sketch into the full 3D logo treatment. Tagline beneath: "Your imagination is the only limit."
- [0:58-1:00] "Play Free on Roblox" with Roblox icon. Release window or "Available Now" depending on timing. Social handles in small text.

## Audio Notes
- **Music**: Cinematic orchestral + electronic hybrid. Composed or licensed in three acts:
  - Act 1 [0:00-0:17]: Quiet, intimate. Solo piano or acoustic guitar. Builds gently as the first drawing comes alive. Adds light strings.
  - Act 2 [0:17-0:38]: Building energy. Percussion enters. Synths layer in during the Neon Grid. Each zone transition adds a new instrument. The multiplayer moment gets a warm, community-feeling swell. The Living Canvas section introduces dissonant tones.
  - Act 3 [0:38-0:55]: Full crescendo. Silence for the Void opening, then a slow orchestral build as the path is constructed. Explosive full-orchestra + electronic drop for The Cliff ascent. Triumphant brass fanfare on the summit landing. Gentle resolution for the endcard.
- **SFX layer**: Pencil-on-paper sounds are the throughline — present in every drawing moment. Materialization sounds vary by material (wood creak, stone thud, balloon poof, metal clang, neon buzz). Environmental sounds are zone-specific but mixed under the music. The fire catching the bridge at [0:17] gets a sharp crackle. The Void silence should be genuinely unsettling — no reverb, no ambience, just the player's footsteps on their own drawings.
- **Voiceover style**: Measured, warm, slightly reverent. This is not a hype narrator — it is someone telling the story of the game with genuine wonder. Long pauses let the visuals breathe. The final "Your imagination is the only limit" is delivered slowly, with weight.

## Render Notes
- 16:9 widescreen. Capture at the highest possible resolution. This is the flagship trailer.
- Camera work should feel cinematic — smooth tracking shots, deliberate push-ins, sweeping orbits. Avoid static or handheld looks. Every shot is composed intentionally.
- Transitions: Use the "ink wash" wipe between zones. Between acts, hard cuts to black.
- Color grade: Desaturated and intimate for Act 1. Progressively more vivid through Act 2. The Void should be near-monochrome (just the player and their glowing drawings). The Cliff summit explodes with golden-hour warmth.
- The split-screen creative solutions at [0:17] should use clean vertical dividers with a slight sketch-line texture.
- Text: Minimal. No text overlays during the trailer body. Title, tagline, and CTA only in the endcard. Let the visuals sell the game.
- Pacing: The first 17 seconds are slow and deliberate. Act 2 accelerates steadily. Act 3 hits the fastest pace at The Cliff, then decelerates to the quiet endcard. The rhythm should feel like a deep breath in, then out.
