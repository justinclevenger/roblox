## Voiceover
[0:00] Draw to Escape. All fifty stages. Let's go.
[0:03] [no VO — drawing sounds]
[0:05] Plank bridge, standard. Move.
[0:07] Balloon skip over the wall. Saves about two seconds.
[0:10] [no VO — rapid drawing]
[0:12] Ice ramp into the Caverns. You slide the entire descent.
[0:15] Here's the trick for the Wetlands — rubber boat. Doesn't slow down in the current.
[0:19] Neon Grid requires exactly three draws if you angle them right.
[0:22] And The Cliff — one balloon, one jump, done.
[0:24] Fifty stages. [pause] That's time.

## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:02] Timer starts. A visible speedrun timer appears in the top-left corner, counting up from 00:00.00 in monospaced font. Stage counter in the top-right reads "1/50." The player character spawns into Stage 1 of the Sketch Fields. No hesitation — they open the canvas immediately.
- [0:02-0:05] SKETCH FIELDS BLITZ (Stages 1-5). The player draws with machine-like precision. Stage 1: a single horizontal plank, placed perfectly across the gap. They sprint across before the materialization particle effects have even finished. Stage 2: a triangular ramp. No wasted lines — three strokes, done. They launch off it. Stage 3-5 blur past in a rapid montage — each drawing is minimal, efficient, and placed with zero adjustment. The stage counter ticks up: 3, 4, 5. The timer reads around 00:08.
- [0:05-0:07] PAPER FOREST SKIP (Stages 6-10). The player draws a single balloon platform, selects Balloon material, and rides it upward over the treetops, bypassing the intended path through the paper canopy entirely. They float over three stages worth of platforms, dropping off the balloon at exactly the right moment to land on the Stage 10 exit. The stage counter jumps from 6 to 10. Timer: 00:14.
- [0:07-0:10] CRAYON CAVERNS DESCENT (Stages 11-15). The player draws one long angled ramp at the cave entrance, selects Ice material. They step onto it and slide the entire length of the caverns — the camera tracks alongside them at speed as crayon-colored walls blur past. They shoot out the far end of the caves. No other drawings needed. Stage counter leaps: 11... 15. Timer: 00:19.
- [0:10-0:13] WATERCOLOR WETLANDS (Stages 16-20). The player draws a boat shape, selects Rubber material. The boat drops into the water and cuts through the current without drifting — rubber grips the water surface. They ride it through all five wetland stages in one continuous run, steering through narrow channels between pastel islands. The camera stays low, near water level, emphasizing the speed. Stage counter: 16... 20. Timer: 00:26.
- [0:13-0:15] INK RUINS SPRINT (Stages 21-25). The crumbling-floor zone. The player does not draw platforms to replace the dissolving tiles — instead, they draw a single wide rubber sheet ahead of themselves and sprint across it before the tiles beneath can crumble. The sheet absorbs the impacts and holds just long enough. One drawing for five stages. Stage counter: 21... 25. Timer: 00:32.
- [0:15-0:17] NEON GRID PRECISION (Stages 26-30). The gravity-flip zone. The player draws three angled metal deflectors, placing them at precise angles before stepping onto the first tile. Each deflector redirects laser beams that would normally block the path. The player walks through the cleared corridor at normal speed — no rushing needed because the geometry is perfect. Stage counter: 26... 30. Timer: 00:39.
- [0:17-0:19] LIVING CANVAS + STORM PEAKS + THE VOID (Stages 31-45). Rapid montage — one second per zone. Living Canvas: player draws a cage around a hostile sketch creature before it even finishes spawning. Storm Peaks: rubber platform (non-conductive) placed once, sprinted across while lightning misses. The Void: the player draws tiles in a straight line at a dead sprint, never stopping, each tile placed exactly one step ahead — a rhythm of draw-step-draw-step-draw-step. The camera pulls back to show the glowing path being built in real-time through darkness. Stage counter races: 35... 40... 45. Timer: 00:54.
- [0:19-0:22] THE CLIFF ASCENT (Stages 46-49). The player does not climb conventionally. They draw one large balloon at the base of the cliff, attach themselves to it (by standing on it as it rises), and float vertically past all four cliff stages. Wind buffets them — they correct with small drawn rudders. Lightning flashes but misses. The camera tilts upward with the ascent, the ground falling away below. Stage counter: 46... 49. Timer: 01:06.
- [0:22-0:24] STAGE 50 — THE FINAL GAP. The player crests the cliff on their balloon and launches off with momentum. Mid-air, they draw a single plank beneath their feet for extra distance. They land on the summit. Timer stops: 01:12.47. Three stars burst. "STAGE 50 COMPLETE." The player does not celebrate — they just stand there. The run is clean.
- [0:24-0:25] The timer freezes on screen. Text overlay: "01:12.47" in large, clean numerals. Beat. "Can you beat it?" Draw to Escape logo. "Play Free on Roblox."

## Audio Notes
- Music: Lo-fi electronic track with a steady, metronomic beat. Not hype — controlled. The tempo matches the pacing of the run: consistent, relentless, never rushing but never pausing. A subtle bass line carries momentum. The track should feel like focused concentration translated into sound.
  - No dynamic builds or drops. The music stays at one level the entire time, reflecting the runner's composure.
  - At [0:22] when the timer stops, the music fades out over one second, leaving only the star chime sounds.
- SFX: Stripped down to essentials. Every sound serves the speedrun:
  - Drawing sounds: Fast pencil scratches — faster than normal gameplay. The player draws quickly.
  - Materialization: A shortened version of the standard whoosh. Clipped to 0.3 seconds instead of the full 0.8.
  - Movement: Footsteps are prominent and rhythmic. On ice, the slide is a clean sustained hiss. On rubber, a slight squeak.
  - Zone transitions: A soft "page turn" whoosh marks each zone change.
  - Timer stop: A crisp digital stopwatch click.
- VO delivery: Calm. Commentating a run they have done many times. No excitement, no frustration — just clean technical narration. Each tip is delivered like it is obvious in hindsight. "Saves about two seconds" is said with the casualness of someone who has optimized every frame. The final "That's time" is quiet, satisfied, understated.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. The timer and stage counter must be visible at all times — they are core to the speedrun format.
- Speed: This is the critical decision. Actual gameplay speed for all sections. Do NOT speed up the footage. The impressiveness comes from the player's speed, not post-production acceleration. If any section feels slow, the solution is to cut it shorter in the edit, not to speed it up.
- The timer must be a real in-game timer or a convincingly integrated overlay. It should feel native to the game, not added in post.
- Color grade: Clean, neutral. No dramatic grading — this is meant to look like authentic gameplay footage. Slightly sharpen the image to make the drawing details crisp.
- Camera work: Mostly follows the player from a consistent third-person angle. Avoid cinematic camera moves — this should look like a gameplay recording. The only exception is the Void section at [0:17-0:19] where the camera pulls back to show the path being built.
- Transitions between zones: Hard cuts. No wipes, no fades. Speedrun content is about efficiency — the editing should match.
- The final time display at [0:24] should hold for a full second before the CTA appears. Let the number sink in.
