## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:04] Zone 1 — THE SKETCH FIELDS. Bright, cheerful tutorial zone. Player draws a simple ramp on a sun-drenched meadow. Flowers and doodle-clouds in the background. Everything looks hand-drawn and friendly. The ramp materializes and the player hops up it with ease.
- [0:04-0:07] Zone 2 — THE PAPER FOREST. Paper-textured trees sway in the wind. Player draws a sail-like shape that catches a gust, propelling them across a gap. Leaves made of paper scraps flutter past. The aesthetic shifts to a warmer, more complex papercraft look.
- [0:07-0:10] Zone 3 — THE CRAYON CAVERNS. Near-total darkness. The player draws a neon lantern that bursts to life, illuminating crayon-scrawled cave walls in vivid color. Camera pulls back to reveal the vast underground space. Stalactites drip with glowing ink.
- [0:10-0:13] Zone 4 — THE WATERCOLOR WETLANDS. Lush watercolor-wash environment. Player draws a wooden raft and floats across a dreamy pastel lake. Lily pads and watercolor fish ripple beneath. Everything has soft, bleeding edges like wet paint.
- [0:13-0:16] Zone 5 — THE INK RUINS. Crumbling ancient structures made of dried ink. The floor breaks apart beneath the player. They frantically draw a platform mid-fall. An ink sentry (a hostile ink blob with glowing eyes) patrols in the background. Darker, more tense atmosphere.
- [0:16-0:20] Zone 6 — THE NEON GRID. Hard cut to a Tron-like wireframe world. Neon lasers sweep across the screen. Player draws a metal shield to deflect a laser, then gravity flips and the player runs on the ceiling. Clone mechanic shown: the player and a ghostly duplicate solve a two-switch puzzle together. High-tech, pulsing visuals.
- [0:20-0:24] Zone 7 — THE STORM PEAKS. Snowy mountain peaks lashed by wind and lightning. Player draws a rubber shelter to survive a lightning strike (electricity arcs around the rubber but doesn't conduct). An avalanche rumbles in the background. Player draws a ramp and launches over tumbling snow boulders.
- [0:24-0:28] Zone 8 — THE LIVING CANVAS. Reality distortion. The player's previous drawings have come alive and turned hostile — a drawn wolf chases them. The environment shifts and morphs like a painting being repainted in real-time. Player draws a cage to trap the hostile drawing. Surreal, unsettling beauty.
- [0:28-0:32] Zone 9 — THE VOID. Pure black emptiness. No ground, no walls, no ceiling. The player draws EVERYTHING — floor tiles, walls, stairs — constructing a path through nothingness one stroke at a time. Each drawn piece glows softly in the void. Lonely, awe-inspiring.
- [0:32-0:35] Zone 10 — THE CLIFF. Massive vertical ascent. Camera tilts upward to show the towering structure. Player draws platforms, hooks, and bridges in rapid succession while climbing. All material types visible in use — wood, metal, balloon, neon. Wind howls. The summit glows above. Player makes a final desperate leap, draws a balloon platform mid-air, and lands on the peak.
- [0:35-0:39] Quick flash montage: one half-second clip from each zone in reverse order (10 down to 1), each with a visual "page turn" transition, ending back on the Sketch Fields.
- [0:39-0:42] Text slam: "How far can you draw?" over a dramatic shot of the player silhouetted against the Void, surrounded by their glowing drawings.
- [0:42-0:45] Draw to Escape logo sketches in. "Play Free on Roblox" appears. Roblox icon.

## Audio Notes
- Music: A single track that evolves across zones. Starts with light acoustic guitar/ukulele for the Sketch Fields. Adds layers progressively — light percussion in Paper Forest, deep bass in Crayon Caverns, flowing pads in Watercolor Wetlands, tension drums in Ink Ruins, hard electronic beats in Neon Grid, orchestral brass in Storm Peaks, distorted/warped synths in Living Canvas, near-silence with a single piano note in The Void, then a full orchestral + electronic crescendo for The Cliff. The flash montage at [0:35] uses rapid rhythmic cuts matching the beat.
- SFX: Each zone has distinct ambient sound (birdsong, wind, dripping, water, crumbling, electronic hum, thunder, warping sounds, silence, howling wind). Drawing and materialization sounds persist throughout but are mixed lower under the music. The final balloon draw at The Cliff summit gets a big satisfying "poof" sound.
- No voiceover during the montage section [0:07-0:35] — the music and visuals carry it entirely. VO bookends the piece.
- Voiceover style: Calm and measured at the opening, building to inspired and epic for the closing lines.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. Each zone clip should be captured with a dynamic camera — slight push-ins, tracking shots, dramatic angles. Avoid static gameplay capture.
- Transitions between zones: Use a "page turn" or "ink wash" wipe that matches the aesthetic. Each transition should feel like turning to the next chapter of a sketchbook.
- Color grade: Each zone has a distinct palette. The contrast between zones should be stark — viewers should immediately feel the shift. Sketch Fields (warm yellow), Paper Forest (warm amber), Crayon Caverns (deep blue/neon), Watercolor Wetlands (soft pastel), Ink Ruins (dark sepia), Neon Grid (cyan/magenta), Storm Peaks (cold grey/blue), Living Canvas (shifting hues), The Void (pure black with soft glow), The Cliff (golden sunrise from above).
- Pacing: Each zone clip is exactly 3-4 seconds. No clip should feel rushed or lingered on. The rhythm should feel like a heartbeat accelerating.
- The flash montage at [0:35] runs at roughly 2 clips per second — fast but each zone should be recognizable for a frame.
