## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:01] Title card: "bro I wasn't ready" in shaky handwritten text on crumpled sketch paper. A single heartbeat sound pulses.
- [0:01-0:04] DEATH 1 — THE ANVIL. Ink Ruins zone. Player draws a massive rectangular block to weigh down a pressure plate. Selects Stone material. The block materializes — but it is absurdly heavy, and the platform they are standing on tilts under the weight. Player slides into the block, gets crushed against the wall. Hard cut to white flash. Screen shakes violently. Ink splatters erupt from both sides. "CRUSHED" drips down the screen in thick black ink. The camera holds on the jumpscare for a full 1.5 seconds — long enough to feel uncomfortable.
- [0:04-0:07] DEATH 2 — THE SLIP. Watercolor Wetlands. Player draws a narrow walkway, selects Ice material by accident. Steps onto it. Feet slide immediately. The character's arms windmill. They skid off the edge into the pastel water and sink. White flash. Screen erupts with watercolor-tinted ink splatters — blues and pinks swirling. "TOO SLIPPERY" in jagged letters shakes across the screen. A ghostly pencil-sketch hand reaches from behind the text.
- [0:07-0:10] DEATH 3 — THE FLOAT AWAY. Neon Grid zone. Player draws a platform to cross a laser field. Selects Balloon material. Steps on. The platform rises straight into the laser grid above. Bright neon slashes cut across the screen. White flash — but this time the flash is neon magenta. Ink splatters are electric, crackling. "ZAPPED" in flickering neon letters. The screen shake is rapid and glitchy, like a monitor malfunction.
- [0:10-0:13] DEATH 4 — THE CRUMBLE. Ink Ruins. Player draws a floor tile and sprints forward. The tile dissolves behind them — standard mechanic. But they draw the next tile too small. One foot lands, the other misses. The tiny tile crumbles under the unbalanced weight. Player falls into the ink void below. The fall is silent. Then — white flash. The entire screen fills with black ink. No splatters this time, just a slow flood of darkness. "THE INK REMEMBERS" appears in thin, precise handwriting that looks like it was written by someone else. Screen shake is slow and deep, like a tremor.
- [0:13-0:16] DEATH 5 — THE CONDUCTOR. Storm Peaks. Player draws a tall metal ramp to reach a high ledge. Starts climbing. A flash of lightning illuminates the sky. The ramp glows white-hot. Electricity arcs up the metal surface and engulfs the player. The screen does not flash white — it flashes inverted colors, negative image, for a single frame. Then the standard ink splatter death screen: "GROUNDED" with jagged electric lines woven through the letters. The screen shake stutters like a strobe.
- [0:16-0:18] RAPID JUMPSCARE MONTAGE. Five death screens slam in at half-second intervals — "CRUSHED" / "TOO SLIPPERY" / "ZAPPED" / "THE INK REMEMBERS" / "GROUNDED" — each with its unique ink splatter and screen shake stacking on top of the last, creating a chaotic collage of death screens layered over each other.
- [0:18-0:20] Silence. Black screen. A single pencil line slowly draws across the center. Text fades in beneath: "play if you dare." Draw to Escape logo sketches itself in. "Play Free on Roblox." The pencil line finishes — and a final subtle ink splatter hits the corner of the screen as a parting jumpscare.

## Audio Notes
- Music: No traditional music track. Instead, a low ambient drone runs underneath — tension without melody. Think horror-adjacent atmospheric sound design. The drone rises in pitch slightly before each death, creating subconscious dread.
- SFX per death:
  - Anvil crush: Heavy stone grinding + a muffled crunch + sudden silence before the flash
  - Ice slip: Cartoon squeak that turns into a wet splash + bubbling as the player sinks
  - Balloon laser: Rising helium whine + sharp electric crack (like a bug zapper)
  - Ink crumble: Soft paper-tearing sound + absolute silence during the fall + a deep bass "THOOM" on the ink flood
  - Lightning conductor: Building static crackle + massive thunder clap + sizzle
- Death screen sounds: The white flash gets a percussive "THWACK" — like a hand slapping wet paper. Each ink splatter has a distinct wet impact sound. Screen shakes get a low sub-bass rumble. "THE INK REMEMBERS" death gets a whispered voice layered under the rumble.
- The rapid montage at [0:16] layers all five death sounds into a wall of noise that cuts to absolute silence for the endcard.
- The final parting splatter at [0:20] gets one last quiet "splat" — a wink to the audience.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. Camera follows each death closely — tight framing to maximize the sudden impact of each jumpscare.
- The white flash frame timing is critical. It should hit exactly 2 frames before the ink splatters appear. Too early and the scare is telegraphed. Too late and it feels disconnected.
- Death screens are captured natively from the game. Do not recreate or modify them.
- Speed: Normal speed for the deaths themselves. Cut all respawn time — jump cut from death screen directly to the next scenario setup.
- Color grade: Each zone should feel slightly darker and more ominous than its normal palette. Desaturate by 10-15% compared to standard gameplay footage. The Void and Ink Ruins deaths should feel genuinely unsettling.
- The rapid montage must maintain exact half-second intervals. Any timing drift kills the rhythm.
- The endcard silence should last a full 1.5 seconds before the pencil line begins. Let the audience sit in the quiet.
- No text overlays during gameplay. The death screens provide all the text needed. Only the endcard has intentional text.
