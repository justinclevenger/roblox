## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:04] Establishing shot of a classic bridge puzzle in the Sketch Fields. A wide gap between two cliff edges with a lava pit below. The player character stands on the left edge. A small material selector UI is visible in the corner. Text overlay fades in: "Same puzzle. 3 materials."
- [0:04-0:08] Attempt 1 — STONE. Player opens canvas, draws a bridge shape. Selects Stone material (grey icon with weight symbol). Bridge materializes as a heavy grey slab. For a split second it holds, then the supports crack under the immense weight and the whole thing plummets straight down into the lava pit. The player, mid-run, falls with it. Death screen: "NOT GOOD ENOUGH" with comedic ink splatter. Quick camera shake.
- [0:08-0:12] Attempt 2 — BALLOON. Same starting position. Player draws the same bridge shape. Selects Balloon material (pink, airy icon). Bridge materializes as a puffy, translucent pink shape. It immediately begins floating upward, lifting off the gap entirely. Player jumps for it, misses, and falls into the lava. Death screen: "DRAW BETTER" with ink splatter. The balloon bridge drifts off-screen above.
- [0:12-0:17] Attempt 3 — WOOD. Same starting position. Player draws the same bridge shape. Selects Wood material (warm brown icon). Bridge materializes as a sturdy wooden plank. It holds. Player runs across confidently. Camera follows the smooth crossing. Player reaches the other side, does a small celebration emote. Stage-clear chime and 1-star pop-up.
- [0:17-0:20] Quick split-screen replay showing all three outcomes side by side in a 3-panel vertical stack: stone falling, balloon floating, wood holding. Each labeled with the material name.
- [0:20-0:23] Text animates in over a dark background: "Every. Material. Matters." Each word punches in separately with a small screen shake.
- [0:23-0:25] Draw to Escape logo sketch animation. "Play Free on Roblox" beneath. Roblox icon.

## Audio Notes
- Music: Quirky, comedic instrumental with a bouncy rhythm. Light pizzicato strings or marimba. Tempo is steady throughout.
- SFX: Heavy stone crumble and crash for the stone bridge failing. Sad trombone or comedy "wah wah" on the first death. Gentle whooshing / squeaky balloon sound for the balloon floating away. Second death gets a quicker comedy sting. Satisfying solid "thunk" when the wood bridge lands and holds. Victory chime for the successful crossing.
- Voiceover style: Casual, slightly amused storytelling tone. Emphasizes the contrast between attempts. Delivers "Just right" with a satisfied grin in the voice.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. Camera angle is consistent across all three attempts — same position, same zoom — to emphasize that only the material changed.
- Speed up the drawing portions to 2x. Play the failure and success moments at normal speed.
- Add a quick "Attempt 1 / 2 / 3" counter in the top corner for each try.
- The split-screen recap at [0:17] should loop each outcome once at 2x speed.
- Color grade: Warm and bright, matching the Sketch Fields palette. Death screens use the game's native ink splatter overlay.
