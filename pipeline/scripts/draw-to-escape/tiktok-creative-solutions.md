## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:04] Opening shot: player character standing in front of a complex-looking puzzle — multiple paths, hazards, moving platforms. The camera slowly zooms in on the character's face as if they're thinking. A lightbulb doodle pops above their head.
- [0:04-0:09] SOLUTION 1 — THE CATAPULT. A wide gap with no obvious crossing. Player opens the canvas and draws a catapult — a rough but recognizable lever-and-bucket shape. Selects Wood material. The catapult materializes at the gap's edge. Player steps into the bucket end, then draws a heavy Stone block above the other end. The stone drops, the lever flings, and the player launches across the gap in a beautiful arc. Camera tracks the flight path. Perfect landing on the other side. Quick celebration pose.
- [0:09-0:12] Brief reaction beat — a "Did that just work?" moment. The player looks back at the catapult, now sitting there as a permanent part of the level. A second player in the background sees it and uses it too.
- [0:12-0:18] SOLUTION 2 — THE GIANT UMBRELLA. A section where rocks and debris rain from above. The obvious solution might be to time a sprint through. Instead, the player draws an enormous umbrella shape, selects Metal material. The umbrella materializes overhead — a massive metallic canopy. Rocks bounce off it with satisfying clangs and sparks. Player casually strolls underneath, completely protected, while chaos rains above. They even do a little dance mid-walk.
- [0:18-0:24] SOLUTION 3 — THE MAGNET CRANE. A heavy metal block sits on a lower platform. It needs to reach a higher platform to press a switch. Player draws a crane arm shape extending from the upper platform, selects Magnet material. The crane materializes and the magnetic force pulls the metal block upward. The block rises, snaps to the crane, and the player nudges it onto the switch. The door opens. Camera pushes in on the satisfying moment of the block clicking into place.
- [0:24-0:29] Rapid-fire montage of other creative solutions: a player draws a trampoline (Rubber material) to bounce over a wall. A player draws a Glass dome to observe a laser pattern safely. A player draws an Ice slide down a steep slope. A player draws a Balloon parachute mid-fall. Each clip is about 1 second — just enough to register the creativity.
- [0:29-0:33] Text animates on screen: "There's no wrong answer. Only creative ones." Each word appears in a different material texture — "There's" in wood, "no" in stone, "wrong" in ice, "answer" in neon, etc.
- [0:33-0:35] Draw to Escape logo sketch animation. "Play Free on Roblox" beneath. Roblox icon.

## Audio Notes
- Music: Upbeat, playful, feel-good track. Think indie game trailer vibes — light guitar, handclaps, whistling. The energy stays consistently high and positive throughout.
- SFX: The catapult launch gets a cartoony "SPROING" plus a whooshing arc sound. Rocks bouncing off the metal umbrella get metallic clangs with slight reverb. The magnet crane gets an electronic hum building as the metal block rises, then a satisfying "CLUNK" when it lands on the switch. The rapid montage gets quick, punchy sound effects for each solution — boing, shatter, swoosh, poof.
- Voiceover style: Casual, slightly bemused, like a friend showing you something cool. The "[beat] Yeah. That works." should sound genuinely delighted and a little surprised. The closing lines are delivered with warmth and a smile.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. Camera should be dynamic — follow the action, track the player, zoom on payoff moments.
- Each solution should be framed to clearly show the cause and effect: the drawing, the materialization, and the result.
- Speed: Drawing portions at 1.5x. Payoff moments at normal or even slight slow-mo (especially the catapult arc and the magnet block rising).
- Color grade: Bright, warm, inviting. Slightly elevated saturation. This should look fun and approachable.
- The rapid montage at [0:24] uses quick jump cuts with a slight zoom punch on each solution.
- The material-textured text at [0:29] should be legible first, stylish second — readability matters.
