## Visual Direction
Shot-by-shot breakdown with timestamps:
- [0:00-0:03] Player character stands at the edge of a wide gap in the Sketch Fields zone. Camera zooms in on the character looking down nervously. Quick cut to the 2D drawing canvas appearing on screen.
- [0:03-0:07] Player draws a simple flat bridge shape on the canvas. Quick whoosh transition as the drawing peels off the canvas and materializes as a 3D wooden plank spanning the gap. Particle effects burst outward from the materialization point.
- [0:07-0:10] Player runs across the bridge. Camera follows from a low angle to emphasize the physicality of the drawn object. The bridge creaks slightly under the player's weight. Satisfying crossing.
- [0:10-0:16] Hard cut to the Watercolor Wetlands. A stretch of water blocks the path. Canvas appears, player draws a rough boat shape, selects Wood material (icon glows). Boat materializes on the water surface, bobs realistically. Player hops in, floats across. Water ripple effects.
- [0:16-0:20] Smash cut to the Crayon Caverns. Screen is nearly pitch black, only the faint outline of the player visible. Canvas opens with a soft glow. Player draws a torch shape, selects Neon material. Torch materializes in the player's vicinity, casting vivid cyan light across the cavern walls, revealing the path ahead. Camera pulls back to show the illuminated cave.
- [0:20-0:24] Rapid montage: 1-second clips of various creative drawings materializing — a ramp, a shield blocking a falling rock, a floating balloon platform, a metal weight pressing a switch. Each clip has a quick zoom punch on the materialization moment.
- [0:24-0:27] Player character stands triumphantly at a stage-clear podium. 3-star rating pops up with sparkle effects.
- [0:27-0:30] Draw to Escape logo animates in (pencil sketches the logo, then it fills with color). "Play Free on Roblox" text appears below. Roblox icon in corner.

## Audio Notes
- Music: High-energy, playful electronic track with a building tempo. Think bright synths and snappy percussion. Slight bass drop at [0:07] when the first bridge materializes.
- SFX: Pencil scratching sounds during all drawing moments. Satisfying "whoosh + crystallize" sound on each materialization. Gentle wood creak on bridge crossing. Water splashing for the boat scene. Electric hum for neon torch ignition. UI chime on 3-star reveal.
- Voiceover style: Enthusiastic, young, fast-paced. The narrator sounds genuinely impressed at each mechanic reveal.

## Render Notes
- 9:16 vertical framing. Gameplay captured at native resolution, cropped to center on the action.
- Add subtle camera shake on each materialization for impact.
- Use 1.5x speed on the drawing portions to keep them snappy, normal speed on the payoff moments.
- Color grade: Bright, saturated, slightly warm. Each zone transition should match that zone's palette.
- Text overlays: None during gameplay — let the visuals speak. Logo and CTA only at the end.
