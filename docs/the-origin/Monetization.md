# The Origin — Monetization Design

## Core Philosophy

1. **No pay-to-win.** Every Robux purchase is cosmetic, convenience, or content. Never gameplay power.
2. **Free path to everything.** Every unlock can be earned through play. Paying accelerates or enhances — never gates.
3. **Level 1 is always free.** It's the hook. The full hospital experience with no strings attached.
4. **Respect the horror.** Cosmetics must enhance (or at least not break) the atmosphere. No neon rainbow flashlights.

## Revenue Stream Breakdown

### 1. Game Passes (One-Time Purchases)

Game Passes are the backbone — high-margin, one-time, account-permanent.

| Pass | Price (Robux) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **All Access Pass** | 799 | Unlocks all 5 levels immediately. Players can still earn sequential unlocks for free — this removes the gate. Positioned as the "supporter" purchase. |
| **Director's Cut** | 399 | Extended lore experience: additional rooms per level, voice-acted audio logs, expanded scripted events, hidden 6th ending path in Level 5. For players who want the full story. |
| **Nightmare Mode** | 249 | After completing a level, replay it with any entity from any level. The Crawlers in the hospital. The Mimic in the subway. Combinatorial replayability. |
| **Co-op Plus** | 149 | Expands party size from 4 to 6 players. More players = more separation events, more chaos, more fun. |
| **Spectator Pass** | 99 | After dying in co-op, freely switch between teammate cameras + entity-perspective cam. Turn death into a horror movie viewing experience. |
| **Photo Mode** | 99 | Post-extraction freeze frame. Pose, adjust camera, screenshot. Share to Roblox feed. Players become free marketing. |

**Conversion strategy:** After Level 1 extraction, show a cinematic preview of Level 2's Crawlers. The adrenaline high + fear of missing out drives the All Access conversion. Don't hard-gate — show a "Continue earning next level" option alongside the purchase prompt.

### 2. Seasonal Pass (Battle Pass Model)

The recurring revenue engine. 30-day cycles.

| Tier | Price | Contents |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Free Track** | 0 | Basic cosmetics (1-2 flashlight tints, 1 outfit recolor), XP boosts, badges |
| **Paid Track** | 299 Robux | Exclusive death animations, flashlight beam patterns, trail effects, entity encounter card borders, featured outfit set, seasonal entity variant preview |

**Progression:**
- Earn pass XP through normal gameplay + themed challenges
- Challenges drive replayability: "Extract from Level 3 without hiding," "Survive 45 seconds at Tier 3+ proximity," "Complete Level 2 using only 1 battery"
- 30 tiers, roughly 1 per day of casual play
- End-of-season exclusive badge for completing paid track (status symbol)

**Season Themes:**
- Season 1: "First Response" (EMT/medical themed cosmetics)
- Season 2: "Urban Decay" (grunge/underground themed)
- Season 3: "Containment Breach" (research station themed)
- Season 4: "Deep Woods" (ranger/survival themed)
- Each season maps loosely to a level — builds anticipation for unreached content

### 3. Cosmetic Shop (Developer Products — Repeatable)

Rotating stock that refreshes weekly. Creates urgency and browsing habit.

#### Death Animations (75-150 Robux each)
How your character goes down when caught. Visible to all co-op players.
- **Static Death** — Character freezes, VHS static overlay, collapses
- **Shadow Pull** — Shadows reach up and drag the character down
- **Glitch Out** — Character model corrupts and despawns
- **Fade to Black** — Slow fade, character reaches toward camera
- **The Drag** — Entity pulls character backward out of frame

#### Flashlight Beams (50-100 Robux each)
Subtle tint/pattern changes. Visible to teammates.
- **Blood Red** — Deep red tint
- **UV Light** — Purple-blue tint (purely cosmetic, no gameplay effect)
- **Strobing** — Slight irregular flicker pattern
- **Wide Beam** — Broader, dimmer spread (visual only, no detection change)
- **Candlelight** — Warm, slightly wavering

#### Trail Effects (75-125 Robux each)
Visual trail when sprinting. Visible to teammates + creates atmosphere.
- **Shadow Mist** — Dark wisps trail behind
- **Sparks** — Faint electrical sparks from feet
- **Paranormal** — Faint ghostly afterimages
- **None** — Default, invisible

#### Extraction Animations (100-150 Robux each)
How you board the extraction vehicle at level end.
- **The Dive** — Desperate leap
- **The Last Look** — Turn back, stare at the building, then leave
- **The Collapse** — Fall into the helicopter, barely made it
- **Cool Walk** — Slow confident walk (comedic contrast with the horror)

#### Entity Encounter Cards (50-100 Robux for frames/borders)
Post-extraction summary screen showing run stats: closest entity proximity, time spent in each fear tier, hiding spots used, distance covered. Sell decorative card frames.
- **Case File** — Manila folder / redacted document style
- **VHS Tape** — Retro horror aesthetic
- **Polaroid** — Instant photo style
- **Incident Report** — Clinical medical document style

### 4. Monster Pass (Post-Launch Game Pass)

Asymmetric multiplayer: 1 player controls the entity, 3-4 players survive.

| Component | Price | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Monster Pass** | 499 Robux | Unlock ability to queue as the entity in asymmetric mode |
| **Entity Skins** | 150-250 Robux each | Visual variants for each entity (The Patient in scrubs vs surgical gown vs straightjacket) |
| **Entity Trail Effects** | 75-125 Robux each | Dark tendrils, flickering shadows, blood footprints |

**Separate progression tree** for entity play: unlock new abilities, sensory upgrades, and cosmetics through entity XP. This creates a whole second game loop.

### 5. Roblox Premium Benefits

Roblox pays developers per Premium-subscriber engagement minute. Making the game sticky for Premium users is pure bonus revenue.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **+20% XP** | All sources — run completion, challenges, lore discovery |
| **Exclusive Cosmetic Set** | One Premium-only outfit per level (5 total). Visible status symbol. |
| **Premium Flashlight Skin** | Distinctive beam that signals "this player supports the game" |
| **Early Seasonal Access** | 1 week early access to each new seasonal pass |
| **Premium Badge** | Profile badge, visible in co-op lobbies |

### 6. Seasonal & Limited Events

Time-limited content creates urgency and spikes player return.

| Event | Timing | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Halloween Horror Nights** | October | Limited entity variant (pumpkin-themed Patient), exclusive cosmetics, bonus level wing, 2x XP weekend |
| **Friday the 13th** | Every occurrence | 24-hour event: entity aggression +50%, double loot, exclusive badge for extracting, XP multiplier |
| **Anniversary Event** | Launch anniversary | New wing added to Level 1 hospital, community challenge milestones, retrospective cosmetics |
| **Community Milestones** | Ongoing | "10M total deaths — unlock community reward." Drives organic engagement metrics. |
| **Winter Event** | December | Frozen hospital variant, ice-themed cosmetics, holiday Safe Room decorations |

## Pricing Strategy

### Anchor Pricing
- All Access Pass at 799 Robux is the anchor — everything else feels cheap by comparison
- Seasonal Pass at 299 is the recurring sweet spot (less than a single outfit in many Roblox games)
- Individual cosmetics at 50-150 keep the impulse purchase threshold low

### Conversion Funnel
```
Free Player (Level 1)
    ↓ completes Level 1, sees Level 2 preview
First Purchase (All Access Pass or Seasonal Pass)
    ↓ plays regularly, sees cosmetics on other players
Cosmetic Buyer (shop items, death animations)
    ↓ deeply engaged, wants more content
Premium Buyer (Director's Cut, Nightmare Mode)
    ↓ wants to experience "the other side"
Monster Pass Buyer (asymmetric mode)
```

### Free-to-Paid Parity
Every game pass unlock has a free earning equivalent:
- Levels: complete prior level to unlock next (All Access just skips the queue)
- Nightmare Mode: can be earned by completing all 5 levels + achieving S-rank on each
- Cosmetics: basic variants earnable through seasonal free track + XP milestones

## Revenue Projections Framework

Rather than fixed projections, use these benchmarks for the Roblox horror genre:

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| DAU (after 3 months) | 5K | 25K | 100K+ |
| Conversion rate (any purchase) | 2-3% | 5-8% | 10-15% |
| ARPPU (avg revenue per paying user) | 200 Robux | 500 Robux | 1,000+ Robux |
| Premium subscriber % | 10% | 20% | 30% |

Key lever: **retention**. Horror games on Roblox spike on launch and holidays. The seasonal pass + Monster Pass are specifically designed to flatten the engagement curve.

## What We Never Sell

Hard rules. Non-negotiable.

1. **No gameplay advantages** — No extra health pips, inventory slots, stamina boosts, entity speed reduction, or detection radius changes for Robux.
2. **No lore paywalls** — All 7 base lore documents are free. Director's Cut sells extended *presentation* (voice acting, extra rooms), not the core story.
3. **No randomized gameplay items** — If it's a lootbox, it's cosmetic-only with published odds (per Roblox policy).
4. **No pay-to-skip-fear** — The proximity fear system is the game. Never sell "fear reduction" or "calm mode."
5. **No exclusive multiplayer matchmaking** — Paying players play with free players. No segregation.

## Implementation Priority

| Phase | Timing | Items |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Launch** | Day 1 | All Access Pass, 3-4 base cosmetics, Premium Benefits, Level 1 free |
| **Month 1** | Week 2-4 | Seasonal Pass (Season 1), expanded cosmetic shop, encounter cards |
| **Month 2-3** | Post-stabilization | Director's Cut, Nightmare Mode, Photo Mode |
| **Month 4-6** | Major update | Monster Pass (asymmetric mode), entity cosmetics |
| **Ongoing** | Monthly | Seasonal pass rotation, limited events, new cosmetics |

## Roblox-Specific Technical Notes

- Game Passes created via Creator Dashboard or `MarketplaceService:PromptGamePassPurchase()`
- Developer Products via `MarketplaceService:PromptProductPurchase()` with `ProcessReceipt` callback
- Track purchases server-side via DataStore — never trust client for ownership checks
- Premium detection: `Players.PlayerMembershipChanged` + `Player.MembershipType`
- Seasonal pass progress stored in per-player DataStore, reset on season rollover
- Cosmetic equip state saved to DataStore, loaded on join
- Shop rotation managed via server-side schedule (not client clock — prevents time manipulation)
