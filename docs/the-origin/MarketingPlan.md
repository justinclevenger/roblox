# The Origin — Marketing & Launch Plan

## Document Overview

This plan covers pre-launch, launch, and post-launch marketing strategy for *The Origin*, a five-level survival horror experience on Roblox. All tactics are specific to Roblox's ecosystem and calibrated for the 2025-2026 landscape. The plan assumes Level 1 (St. Maren's Hospital) ships as the free hook with the All Access Pass (799 Robux) unlocking the full campaign at launch.

**Target audience:** Roblox players aged 13-21 who play horror experiences (Doors, Apeirophobia, The Mimic, Pressure, Fisch horror events). Secondary audience: general Roblox players drawn in by social proof and creator content.

**Core marketing thesis:** Horror sells itself when the content is real. The game's adaptive AI, proximity fear system, and no-combat design are genuinely differentiated. The marketing strategy is built around *showing real gameplay* rather than manufactured hype. Let the game terrify people on camera and let those clips do the work.

## 1. Pre-Launch Phase (Weeks -6 to -1)

### 1.1 Teaser Content Strategy

The goal of pre-launch is to build anticipation without revealing the game's strongest moments. Horror thrives on the unknown. Every piece of content released should raise more questions than it answers.

#### What to Show

| Content Type | Details | When |
|---|---|---|
| Environment teases | Short clips of the hospital — dark corridors, flickering lights, empty rooms. No entity visible. | Weeks 6-5 |
| Audio teasers | 10-15 second audio clips: the flatline sound, a door slamming, proximity breathing, the phone ringing in reception | Weeks 5-4 |
| Proximity Fear System preview | Side-by-side: normal gameplay vs. Tier 3 (PANIC) — show the desaturation, heartbeat, screen distortion without revealing the entity | Week 4 |
| "Patient 31" lore drops | Redacted document images (incident reports, the patient chart) posted as if they are real leaked files | Weeks 4-3 |
| First entity glimpse | A 3-second clip: flashlight sweeps a corridor, something is there, flashlight flickers, it is gone | Week 3 |
| Gameplay trailer (60-90s) | Real gameplay from Level 1. Show hiding, sprinting, the generator sequence, the fear system. End on the extraction helicopter moment. | Week 2 |
| Co-op chaos clip | 30-second clip of a 4-player session — proximity voice panic, separation event, one player screaming while another hides in silence | Week 1 |

#### What to Hold Back

- **Levels 2-5 entirely.** Do not show the subway, research station, forest, or catacombs. Let Level 1 be the only known quantity. Players discovering Level 2's Crawlers for the first time should be a genuine shock.
- **Entity AI behavior.** Show that the entity exists. Do not explain the adaptive behavior system, hiding spot memory, or route learning. Let players and creators discover and document these mechanics organically.
- **The Mimic and The Watchers.** These entities are the game's biggest "wait, WHAT" moments. Zero footage. Zero hints. The discovery of the Mimic disguising as a teammate will be a viral moment — do not spoil it.
- **Lore connections.** Do not explain the relationship between levels. The lore ARG (see Section 5) handles this.
- **The choice at the end.** Two endings should be discovered by the community, not marketed.

### 1.2 Platform-Specific Tactics

#### YouTube

- **Target format:** 60-90 second trailer, vertical shorts (15-30s clips)
- **Trailer strategy:** Upload the main gameplay trailer to the game's official channel (create one). Optimize title for Roblox search: "The Origin - Official Trailer | Roblox Horror Game 2026"
- **Shorts:** 3-5 vertical clips pulled from the trailer and playtest footage. Focus on reaction moments: the phone ringing, the generator pull-cord sequence, the first entity encounter. Use text overlays ("POV: you hear footsteps stop outside your hiding spot")
- **SEO targets:** "new roblox horror game 2026," "scariest roblox game," "roblox horror game like doors," "roblox survival horror"
- **Community posts:** Use YouTube community tab for lore drops (redacted documents, audio clips)

#### TikTok

- **Target format:** 15-30 second clips, vertical, native captions
- **Content angles:**
  - POV clips from gameplay ("POV: the entity learned where you hide")
  - Audio-first clips (play the proximity fear audio escalation over black screen with captions)
  - "What would you do?" clips (show a gameplay scenario, ask viewers to comment their strategy)
  - Behind-the-scenes dev clips (showing the AI behavior system, entity patrol routes visualized)
  - Lore document reveals as "found footage" style posts
- **Hashtags:** #RobloxHorror #TheOrigin #RobloxGame #HorrorGame #SurvivalHorror #ScariestRobloxGame
- **Posting cadence:** 4-5 TikToks per week starting 4 weeks before launch, increasing to daily in launch week
- **Sound strategy:** Create a distinctive audio clip from the game (the flatline tone, the proximity heartbeat) and use it as a branded sound. If it catches on, organic creators will use it.

#### Twitter/X

- **Target format:** Short-form text + media, engagement bait, lore drops
- **Content strategy:**
  - Countdown posts starting at 2 weeks out
  - Developer diary threads (1-2 threads about design philosophy: "Why we removed all weapons," "How the AI learns your habits")
  - Engagement posts: polls ("Entity approaches. You have 1 flare and 2 batteries. What do you drop?"), "Caption this" with scary screenshots
  - Retweet and amplify any creator or player content about the game
  - Quote-tweet reactions from playtesters
- **Cadence:** 1-2 posts per day, 3-4 in launch week

#### Roblox Social Features

- **Roblox Group:** Create the official game group 6 weeks before launch. Post lore updates, development screenshots, and countdowns to the group wall. Use group shouts for major announcements.
- **Experience page:** Set up the experience page early with a "Coming Soon" description, thumbnail, and icon. Use the description for lore hooks ("St. Maren's Hospital was abandoned three weeks ago. The last staff report mentions Patient 31. Respond to the distress signal. Find out what happened.").
- **Roblox badges:** Pre-configure launch day badges (First Extraction, Day One Survivor) to reward early players.
- **Social links:** Connect Discord, YouTube, and Twitter/X to the Roblox group page.

### 1.3 Influencer/Content Creator Outreach

Detailed in Section 4 below. In the pre-launch phase:

- **Weeks 6-5:** Identify and reach out to Tier 1 and Tier 2 creators (see Section 4.1)
- **Weeks 4-3:** Send early access builds to confirmed Tier 1 creators under embargo (Level 1 only)
- **Week 2:** Lift embargo — Tier 1 creators publish "first look" videos
- **Week 1:** Tier 2 creators get access, publish content day-of or day-before launch
- **Launch day:** Tier 3 (micro) creators get access codes to share with their audiences

### 1.4 Community Building (Pre-Launch)

- **Discord server:** Launch 6 weeks before release. Structure detailed in Section 5.1.
- **Lore ARG:** Begin dropping cryptic lore content across Discord, Twitter/X, and TikTok. See Section 5.3 for the full ARG design.
- **Playtest events:** Run 2-3 closed playtests via Discord (Level 1 only, 50-100 players each). Participants get an exclusive in-game badge. This serves dual purpose: QA feedback and community investment.
- **Waitlist / notification:** Encourage players to favorite the experience on Roblox and join the group for launch notification.

## 2. Launch Phase (Launch Week)

### 2.1 Launch Day Tactics

**Timing:** Launch on a Friday afternoon (US time zones). Roblox traffic peaks Friday evening through Sunday. This gives maximum exposure during the first 48 hours, which are critical for algorithmic placement.

**Launch day sequence:**

| Time (US Eastern) | Action |
|---|---|
| 12:00 PM | Experience goes live. Social posts across all platforms: "St. Maren's Hospital is open." |
| 12:00 PM | Group shout to all members. Discord @everyone announcement with play link. |
| 12:00-2:00 PM | Tier 1 creators go live on YouTube/Twitch (pre-coordinated). |
| 2:00 PM | First wave of TikTok launch clips from official account. |
| 3:00-6:00 PM | Tier 2 creators publish videos/streams. |
| 6:00 PM | Sponsored Experiences campaign activates (if budget allows). |
| Evening | Monitor CCU, respond to issues, engage with community. |
| Saturday | Community event: "First 1,000 extractions" tracker on Discord. |
| Sunday | Highlight reel of best creator reactions posted across platforms. |

**Launch day content drops:**

- Official launch trailer (updated version of the pre-launch trailer with final polish)
- "How to Play" guide on the experience description page and Discord
- Behind-the-scenes post about the entity AI (now that players can experience it, revealing the systems is safe and generates discussion)

### 2.2 Roblox-Specific Discovery

#### Sponsored Experiences

Roblox Sponsored Experiences are the platform's native advertising. They appear in the Discover page, in-experience portals, and search results.

- **Campaign timing:** Start on launch day, run for 7-14 days
- **Targeting:** Age 13+, interests: horror, adventure, survival. Target players of Doors, Apeirophobia, The Mimic, Pressure, Blair, Evade, and similar horror experiences
- **Creative:** Use the game thumbnail and a short description emphasizing the free-to-play hook: "Level 1 is free. Can you survive St. Maren's Hospital?"
- **Budget:** See Section 6 for ranges. Allocate 60% of paid budget to the first 7 days
- **Optimization:** Monitor cost-per-play and conversion to All Access Pass. Pause underperforming creatives within 48 hours. A/B test at least 3 thumbnail variants

#### Sort Algorithm Optimization

Roblox's Discover page is driven by engagement metrics. The goal is to signal quality to the algorithm in the first 48 hours:

- **Session time:** The 10-25 minute per-run design is already strong. Horror games that keep players for 15+ minutes per session get algorithmic preference.
- **Return rate:** The death-and-retry loop, combined with adaptive AI that makes each run feel different, drives same-day returns. Track Day 1 retention obsessively.
- **Social signals:** Players who play together return more. The co-op design and proximity voice create shareable moments that drive group returns.
- **Favorites and thumbs up:** Prompt for a favorite/like after the first successful extraction (not before — earn it first). Never prompt during gameplay.
- **Roblox Search:** Ensure the experience title, description, and tags include "horror," "survival," "scary," "co-op," and "multiplayer." Roblox search is keyword-driven.

#### Social Features

- **Invite prompts:** After a co-op session, show a "Play again with friends" prompt that sends Roblox invites.
- **Share button:** After extraction, offer a one-tap share to Roblox feed with run stats (time survived, closest entity proximity, fear tier stats). This acts as organic social proof on players' profiles.

### 2.3 Content Creator Coordination (Launch Week)

- All Tier 1 creators go live or publish within the first 6 hours. Coordinate to stagger start times so there is continuous coverage.
- Provide creators with a Level 2 teaser clip they can show at the end of their video ("Next time...") — this drives viewer demand for All Access Pass content.
- Supply creators with a custom Roblox referral link or promo code for tracking (if Roblox affiliate features support it; otherwise track via unique badges).
- Encourage creators to play co-op with each other for cross-audience pollination.
- Prepare a "creator reaction highlight reel" from launch day streams to post on official channels within 48 hours.

### 2.4 Community Events (Launch Week)

| Event | Description | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| First Extraction Race | First 100 players to extract from Level 1 get an exclusive badge | "First Response" badge |
| Community Kill Count | Track total player deaths across all servers. Hit 10,000 deaths for a community reward unlock. | Exclusive flashlight skin for all players |
| Speedrun Challenge | Fastest Level 1 extraction posted to Discord wins a featured spot | Leaderboard badge + Discord role |
| Screenshot Contest | Best screenshot from Level 1 (Photo Mode if available, or F12) | Featured on official social accounts |
| Lore Hunt | First player/team to find all 7 lore documents and piece together the Patient 31 story | Exclusive "Investigator" badge |

---

## 3. Post-Launch Growth (Months 1-6)

### 3.1 Retention Strategies

Horror games on Roblox follow a characteristic pattern: massive launch spike, rapid initial drop, then stabilization around a core audience. The goal is to flatten the drop and grow the floor.

**Week 1-2 retention drivers:**
- Adaptive AI means no two runs feel identical — communicate this explicitly ("The entity remembers where you hid last time")
- Co-op mode drives social retention (players return because friends want to play)
- Level progression (beating Level 1 unlocks Level 2) creates a natural "one more level" pull
- Seasonal Pass launches in Week 2 with 30 tiers of content to chase

**Month 1-3 retention drivers:**
- Director's Cut (Month 2) adds new rooms and voice-acted lore to every level — reason to replay
- Nightmare Mode (Month 2-3) creates combinatorial replayability (any entity in any level)
- Monthly seasonal pass rotation with themed challenges
- Difficulty modifiers for experienced players (no flashlight, faster entity, fog, permadeath)
- Community events and limited-time content (see 3.3)

**Month 4-6 retention drivers:**
- Monster Pass (Month 4-6) introduces an entirely new game mode (asymmetric multiplayer)
- This effectively doubles the game — new progression tree, new player-vs-player dynamic
- Seasonal events (Halloween, Friday the 13th) drive return spikes
- Community-discovered lore and ARG progression keeps the subreddit and Discord active

### 3.2 Content Update Cadence

| Timing | Update | Marketing Angle |
|---|---|---|
| Week 2 | Seasonal Pass Season 1 ("First Response") launches | "30 days of horror-themed challenges and exclusive cosmetics" |
| Week 3-4 | Balance patch + QA fixes based on player data | Dev blog: "What the AI learned from 1 million player deaths" (data-driven content) |
| Month 2 | Director's Cut game pass + Nightmare Mode | "The story goes deeper. New rooms. New recordings. New terrors." |
| Month 3 | Season 2 ("Urban Decay") + limited-time event | Subway-themed cosmetics tease Level 2 atmosphere |
| Month 4 | Co-op Plus (6-player mode) | "More players. More chaos. More screaming." |
| Month 5 | Monster Pass (asymmetric multiplayer) | Major marketing push — treat as a second launch event |
| Month 6 | Season 3 ("Containment Breach") + Anniversary prep | Research station theme. Begin teasing Year 1 anniversary event. |

### 3.3 Seasonal Event Marketing

| Event | Timing | Marketing Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Friday the 13th** | Every occurrence (check calendar) | 24-hour flash event. Announce morning-of on all platforms. Entity aggression +50%, double loot, exclusive badge. Urgency-driven: "You have 24 hours." |
| **Halloween Horror Nights** | October (2-week event) | Biggest annual event. Pumpkin-themed Patient entity variant. Exclusive cosmetics. Bonus level wing. 2x XP. Content creators get early access to the variant. Full marketing push: trailer, TikTok, sponsored experiences. |
| **Winter Event** | December (2-week event) | Frozen hospital variant. Ice-themed cosmetics. Holiday Safe Room decorations. Lighter tone than Halloween — "even horror gets festive." |
| **Anniversary** | Launch month +1 year | New permanent wing added to Level 1. Retrospective trailer. Community milestone celebration. Exclusive "Year One" cosmetics. |
| **Community Milestones** | Ongoing | Track cumulative stats (total deaths, total extractions, total hours in darkness). Hit milestones, unlock community rewards. Post progress on social media. "The community has died 10 million times. Reward unlocked for everyone." |

### 3.4 User-Generated Content & Community Engagement

- **Fan art features:** Weekly fan art spotlight on Discord and social media. Builds community investment.
- **Speedrun leaderboards:** Official leaderboards for each level. Speedrun content is highly watchable and generates organic YouTube/TikTok content.
- **Strategy guides encouraged:** Do not gatekeep game knowledge. When players share AI behavior analysis, entity pattern guides, and optimal routes, amplify it. This content drives discovery and makes the game feel deep.
- **Lore theorycrafting:** Actively engage with (but never fully confirm) community lore theories on Discord and Reddit. Mystery drives engagement. See Section 5.3.
- **Community challenges:** Monthly challenges with specific constraints ("Extract from Level 3 without using a single flare"). Completions earn badges and get featured.

### 3.5 Cross-Promotion Opportunities

- **Other Roblox horror games:** Reach out to developers of Doors, Apeirophobia, The Mimic, and Pressure for mutual promotion. In-game portals, social media shoutouts, or collaborative limited-time events ("The Crossover Event" — a themed cosmetic collaboration).
- **Roblox events:** Participate in Roblox-organized events (Innovation Awards, seasonal platform events). These provide visibility to the broader Roblox audience.
- **Horror media tie-ins:** If a major horror film or show launches, create a themed limited-time event. Horror audiences cross-pollinate.
- **Roblox Creator Marketplace:** If the game's entity models, fear system effects, or audio design become notable, consider releasing sanitized versions on the Creator Marketplace for brand awareness.

## 4. Content Creator Strategy

### 4.1 Creator Tier System

| Tier | Audience Size | Estimated Count to Target | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 — Mega Creators** | 500K+ subscribers/followers | 3-5 creators | Launch day headliners. Drive initial awareness spike. Their videos become the "first impression" for millions. |
| **Tier 2 — Mid Creators** | 50K-500K subscribers/followers | 10-20 creators | Sustained coverage in launch week. Deeper dives, full playthroughs, lore analysis. More engaged audiences. |
| **Tier 3 — Micro Creators** | 5K-50K subscribers/followers | 30-50+ creators | Long-tail coverage. Niche horror communities. High engagement rates. Community trust. |

#### Tier 1 Targets (Roblox Horror Creators)

Identify and prioritize creators who regularly cover Roblox horror content. Key profiles to pursue:

- Roblox horror YouTubers with 500K+ subs who covered Doors, Apeirophobia, or The Mimic at launch
- General Roblox YouTubers (1M+) who occasionally cover horror content
- Horror gaming streamers on Twitch who have played Roblox horror before
- TikTok creators (500K+) who post Roblox horror clips

#### Tier 2 Targets

- Roblox-focused YouTube channels (50K-500K) that cover new experiences regularly
- Horror content creators who do not normally cover Roblox (the game's quality may pull them in)
- Roblox group/clan leaders with large, active communities
- Spanish-language and Portuguese-language Roblox creators (large international Roblox audiences)

#### Tier 3 Targets

- Small Roblox horror YouTubers and TikTokers
- Discord community moderators with active horror gaming servers
- Reddit users active in r/roblox and horror gaming subreddits
- Fan wiki editors and lore community members

### 4.2 What to Provide Creators

| Tier | Early Access | Exclusive Content | Compensation | Expectations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | 2 weeks before launch (Level 1 only, under embargo) | Exclusive Level 2 teaser clip (30s). Custom in-game badge for their community ("played with [creator name]"). Private dev Q&A session. | Negotiate per creator. Options: flat fee, revenue share on referred purchases, or Robux equivalent. Budget 500-2,000 USD equivalent per Tier 1 creator. | 1 dedicated video (10+ min) OR 1 livestream (1+ hour) within first 48 hours of launch |
| **Tier 2** | 3-5 days before launch (Level 1 only) | Promo codes for 5-10 All Access Passes to give away to their audience. In-game "Creator" badge. | Promo code giveaways only (no direct payment). The game and audience access is the value proposition. | 1 video or stream within launch week |
| **Tier 3** | Launch day access code (no early access) | 2-3 All Access Pass promo codes for giveaways | No direct compensation. Badge + codes only. | No hard expectations. Provide assets and hope for organic coverage. |

### 4.3 Horror-Specific Content Angles by Platform

#### YouTube (Long-Form)

Angles that perform well for Roblox horror content on YouTube:

- **"This Roblox game is ACTUALLY scary"** — The comparison angle. Position The Origin against the "not really scary" reputation of most Roblox horror games. The adaptive AI and proximity fear system give creators genuine material.
- **Full blind playthrough** — Unedited or lightly edited first-time playthroughs. Genuine reactions to the phone ringing, the generator sequence, and the entity encounter are the content. Do not over-brief creators.
- **Co-op chaos** — 3-4 creator collab videos. Proximity voice creates natural comedy and tension. Separation events produce content gold ("Wait, where did you go? WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED?").
- **Lore deep dive** — After initial gameplay videos, a dedicated video analyzing the lore documents, Patient 31's story, and connections between levels. This format has high engagement and long watch time.
- **"The AI is learning..."** — Videos focused on the adaptive behavior system. Show the entity checking hiding spots the player previously used. This is a unique mechanic that generates discussion and differentiation.
- **Challenge runs** — No flashlight run, speedrun, no hiding run. These emerge organically but can be suggested to creators.

#### TikTok (Short-Form)

- **Jump scare reaction clips** — 15 seconds. Creator face cam + game footage. The moment something happens. These are TikTok's bread and butter for gaming content.
- **POV format** — "POV: you hear breathing behind the locker door" with gameplay footage
- **"Did you notice?"** — Short clips pointing out subtle details (the CCTV showing the player from an impossible angle, the courtyard entity that vanishes, coffee still warm)
- **Audio clips** — Use the game's audio (heartbeat escalation, flatline, whispers) as background for horror-themed TikToks
- **Duet bait** — Post a clip of a terrifying moment and ask "what would you do?" — encourages duets and stitches

#### Twitch (Live)

- **First playthrough streams** — The genuine, unscripted reaction is the product. Horror games on Twitch thrive on live reactions.
- **Co-op streams with other creators** — Cross-pollinate audiences. Proximity voice makes this inherently entertaining.
- **Community play sessions** — Creator joins random lobbies with viewers. The social dynamic drives chat engagement.
- **Challenge stream** — "I won't stop streaming until I beat all 5 levels." Endurance content format that drives viewership over hours.

### 4.4 Roblox-Specific Creator Programs

- **Roblox Star Creator Program:** If any targeted creators are in the Roblox Star program, their coverage carries additional weight (Star creators get algorithmic boosts on the platform). Prioritize these creators.
- **Roblox Video Stars:** Creators in this program can create in-game Star Creator items. A co-branded flashlight skin or badge tied to a Star Creator drives mutual promotion.
- **Creator Marketplace:** Consider creating a "Creator Kit" on the Roblox Creator Marketplace with promotional assets (thumbnails, entity models for thumbnail creation, audio files) that creators can use in their own content.

### 5.3 Lore ARG / Mystery Elements

The game's lore — Patient 31, Project ECHO, the entities, the Seal — is rich material for an alternate reality game that keeps the community engaged between play sessions.

#### ARG Timeline

**Pre-Launch (Weeks 6-1):**

1. **Week 6:** A new Twitter/X account appears: @StMarensHospital. Posts automated maintenance updates as if the hospital is still operational. "HVAC system check complete. Sub-basement access restricted. Routine."
2. **Week 5:** The automated posts start glitching. "Patient transfer to BLACKPOINT COM— [ERROR] Routine." A post goes out at 3:00 AM: "It got out."
3. **Week 4:** Discord server opens. A hidden channel called #patient-31 is accessible only by solving a cipher posted on the @StMarensHospital account. The channel contains a single image: a redacted incident report.
4. **Week 3:** A second account appears: @BlackpointCoastal. Posts scientific data as if from an active research facility. "Specimen behavioral analysis: mimicry threshold exceeded. Recommend containment upgrade." Community begins connecting the two accounts.
5. **Week 2:** Both accounts go silent simultaneously. A third account posts a single coordinate: the location of St. Maren's Hospital in the game.
6. **Week 1:** A final post from @StMarensHospital: "If you're reading this, the distress signal worked. Do not come alone."

**Post-Launch (Ongoing):**

- Weekly lore drops in the #lore-theories Discord channel — always as in-universe documents (memos, reports, audio transcripts)
- Hidden codes in patch notes that decode to lore fragments
- Community lore challenges: "Find the connection between the shipping manifests in Level 1 and the graffiti in Level 2"
- Developer engagement in lore threads — never confirming or denying theories, only asking leading questions ("Has anyone checked what's written on the walls in Padded Cell B?")
- Seasonal ARG events tied to content updates (the Monster Pass launch could be preceded by an in-universe "containment breach report")

#### Design Rules for the ARG

- Never break character on ARG accounts
- The ARG should be discoverable but not required — players who ignore it lose nothing gameplay-wise
- All ARG revelations should eventually be confirmable in-game
- Do not make the ARG too difficult — the goal is community participation, not puzzle elitism
- Keep a master document of all ARG content and planned reveals to maintain consistency

### 5.4 User Feedback Loops

- **Bug reports:** Structured template in Discord (#bug-reports) and an in-game report button that sends to a moderation queue
- **Suggestion voting:** Monthly community polls on Discord for prioritizing requested features (choose from a curated list — do not run open polls that create undeliverable expectations)
- **Playtest feedback:** Closed playtests before major updates (Monster Pass, seasonal events) with NDA and feedback forms
- **Data-driven iteration:** Track player behavior data (where players die most, which hiding spots are overused, which levels have the lowest completion rate) and share anonymized insights with the community via dev blogs. This makes players feel heard and positions the dev team as responsive.
- **Response time commitment:** Acknowledge bugs within 24 hours on Discord. Fix critical issues within 48 hours. Non-critical fixes on a weekly patch cadence.

## 6. Budget Considerations

### 6.1 Roblox Sponsored Experiences

Sponsored Experiences costs vary by targeting, competition, and time of year. Based on 2025-2026 Roblox advertising benchmarks:

| Budget Tier | Daily Spend | Campaign Duration | Expected Plays | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Minimum Viable** | 50-100 USD/day | 7 days | 10K-30K plays | Enough to seed initial discovery. Relies heavily on organic growth. |
| **Moderate** | 200-500 USD/day | 14 days | 50K-150K plays | Solid launch push. Allows A/B testing of creatives. Recommended starting point. |
| **Aggressive** | 1,000-2,000 USD/day | 14-30 days | 200K-500K+ plays | For maximum launch impact. Requires strong conversion metrics to justify ROI. |

**Optimization tips:**
- Start with the moderate tier. Scale up if Day 1 conversion rate (play-to-All-Access-Pass purchase) exceeds 3%.
- Front-load budget: 60% of total spend in the first 7 days, 40% in days 8-14.
- A/B test at least 3 ad thumbnails. Horror thumbnails with dark, atmospheric imagery and minimal text tend to outperform busy, text-heavy alternatives on Roblox.
- Target players who have recently played competing horror experiences for highest conversion.
- Pause and reassess if cost-per-play exceeds 0.10 USD consistently.

### 6.2 Creator Compensation Tiers

| Tier | Compensation Model | Estimated Cost Per Creator | Total Budget (estimated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 (3-5 creators)** | Flat fee OR revenue share on referred conversions | 500-2,000 USD equivalent per creator | 1,500-10,000 USD |
| **Tier 2 (10-20 creators)** | Promo codes only (5-10 All Access Pass codes each = 3,995-7,990 Robux per creator, cost to dev is zero since these are digital goods) | 0 USD cash (opportunity cost of ~50-200 unredeemed passes) | 0 USD cash |
| **Tier 3 (30-50 creators)** | 2-3 promo codes each + badge | 0 USD cash | 0 USD cash |

**Notes on creator economics:**
- Most Roblox horror creators in the 50K-500K range will cover a genuinely good horror game without payment if given early access. The content itself (reactions, scares, lore) is valuable to their channel.
- Tier 1 creators with 1M+ subscribers may require payment. Negotiate based on expected video views, not subscriber count.
- Never pay for guaranteed positive coverage. Pay for access and exposure; let the game quality speak for itself.
- Track creator-driven installs via custom badges or referral codes where possible.

### 6.3 Organic vs. Paid Split Recommendations

| Phase | Organic | Paid | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-Launch** | 90% | 10% | Build community and creator relationships organically. Minimal paid spend (boosted social posts only). |
| **Launch Week** | 40% | 60% | Maximum paid push to accelerate algorithmic momentum. Once the algorithm picks up the game, organic takes over. |
| **Month 1** | 60% | 40% | Reduce paid spend as organic word-of-mouth and creator content compounds. Maintain sponsored experiences at moderate level. |
| **Months 2-6** | 80% | 20% | Paid spend limited to event spikes (Halloween, Monster Pass launch, seasonal resets). Organic retention should carry the baseline. |
| **Ongoing** | 85-90% | 10-15% | Maintenance spend. Spike for major updates. |

### 6.4 Total Budget Ranges

| Scenario | First-Month Budget | 6-Month Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | 500-2,000 USD | 3,000-8,000 USD | No Tier 1 creator payments. Minimal sponsored experiences. Relies on game quality and organic discovery. Viable if Level 1 is genuinely best-in-class. |
| **Moderate** | 5,000-15,000 USD | 20,000-50,000 USD | 2-3 paid Tier 1 creators. 14-day sponsored experience campaign. Event-spike paid pushes. Recommended for most indie Roblox studios. |
| **Aggressive** | 20,000-50,000 USD | 75,000-150,000 USD | Full Tier 1 creator roster. 30-day aggressive sponsored experience campaign. Paid social media ads (TikTok, YouTube pre-roll). Only justified if studio has funding and high confidence in conversion metrics. |

## 7. KPIs and Success Metrics

### 7.1 Launch Targets (First 7 Days)

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total plays (unique players) | 25,000 | 100,000 | 500,000+ |
| Peak concurrent users (CCU) | 500 | 2,000 | 10,000+ |
| All Access Pass conversion rate | 2% | 5% | 8%+ |
| All Access Pass units sold | 500 | 5,000 | 40,000+ |
| Average session time | 12 min | 18 min | 22+ min |
| Thumbs up ratio | 70%+ | 80%+ | 85%+ |
| Discord members | 2,000 | 5,000 | 15,000+ |
| Roblox Group members | 5,000 | 20,000 | 75,000+ |

### 7.2 Retention Benchmarks

Roblox horror game retention benchmarks (based on genre analysis of top-performing titles in 2024-2025):

| Metric | Below Average | Average | Good | Excellent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Day 1 retention** (return within 24 hours) | <15% | 15-25% | 25-35% | 35%+ |
| **Day 7 retention** | <5% | 5-10% | 10-18% | 18%+ |
| **Day 30 retention** | <2% | 2-5% | 5-10% | 10%+ |
| **Session frequency** (sessions per week, active players) | 1-2 | 2-3 | 3-5 | 5+ |
| **Level 1 completion rate** | 15% | 25% | 35% | 45%+ |

**The Origin's retention advantages:**
- Adaptive AI ensures repeat runs feel different (counters "I've seen it all" dropout)
- 5-level campaign creates multi-session progression pull
- Co-op with proximity voice creates social retention (players return because friends want to play)
- Seasonal pass provides daily engagement targets
- Monster Pass (Month 4-6) adds an entirely new game mode for returning players

**Retention red flags to watch:**
- Level 1 completion rate below 20% — indicates difficulty is too high for the free tier, which kills conversion. Consider adjusting rubber-banding thresholds.
- Day 1 retention below 15% — the free experience is not compelling enough. Investigate where players are dropping (before first entity encounter? during generator sequence?).
- All Access Pass conversion below 2% — the Level 1-to-Level 2 transition is not generating enough desire. Consider improving the post-extraction Level 2 teaser cinematic.

### 7.3 Revenue Milestones

Based on Roblox developer revenue (after Roblox's ~75% platform cut for in-experience purchases, actual developer payout is approximately 25% of Robux spent):

| Milestone | Robux Earned (Gross) | Developer Payout (est.) | Timing Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Break even on moderate marketing budget** | 2M-6M Robux | 5,000-15,000 USD | Month 1-2 |
| **Sustainable** (covers ongoing development) | 10M-20M Robux | 25,000-50,000 USD | Month 3-4 |
| **Success** (profitable, funds next project) | 50M-100M Robux | 125,000-250,000 USD | Month 6-12 |
| **Breakout hit** | 200M+ Robux | 500,000+ USD | Year 1 |

**Revenue tracking priorities:**
- All Access Pass conversion rate (primary revenue driver at launch)
- Seasonal Pass attach rate among active players (recurring revenue health)
- ARPPU (average revenue per paying user) — target 400-600 Robux
- Premium subscriber engagement minutes (passive revenue from Roblox Premium payouts)
- Cosmetic shop weekly revenue (should grow as player base matures and cosmetic catalog expands)

### 7.4 Content & Community KPIs

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 6) |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube videos about The Origin | 50+ | 500+ |
| TikTok videos with game hashtag | 200+ | 2,000+ |
| Discord active members (weekly) | 2,000+ | 8,000+ |
| Roblox Group members | 20,000+ | 100,000+ |
| Fan wiki pages (if community creates one) | 20+ | 100+ |
| Lore theories posted in community | 50+ | 300+ |
| Speedrun records submitted | 10+ | 100+ |
| Creator videos/streams (all tiers) | 30+ | 200+ |

## Appendix C: Competitive Landscape

Understanding where The Origin sits relative to existing Roblox horror experiences:

| Game | Monthly Visits (est.) | Strengths | The Origin's Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Doors** | 50M+ | Procedural rooms, collectibles, frequent updates | Deeper AI (adaptive, entity memory), stronger narrative, proximity fear system, no-combat focus |
| **Apeirophobia** | 10M+ | Backrooms aesthetic, level variety | Tighter level design, better entity AI, co-op with proximity voice |
| **The Mimic** | 15M+ | Strong lore and atmosphere | Adaptive AI (The Mimic inspired one of our entities), mechanical depth (stamina, inventory, health system) |
| **Pressure** | 5M+ | Underwater horror, unique setting | Multi-level campaign, entity variety, replay value through adaptive AI and Nightmare Mode |
| **Blair** | 8M+ | Found footage aesthetic, co-op | Deeper gameplay systems, longer campaign, proximity voice integration |
| **Evade** | 20M+ | Simple, accessible, social | More sophisticated horror (genuine dread vs. chase game), narrative depth |

**Positioning statement:** The Origin is the first Roblox horror experience built around adaptive entity AI and a multi-level narrative campaign. It is not a jump-scare runner. It is survival horror where the game learns how you play and forces you to adapt. Level 1 is free. Bring friends. Trust no one.
