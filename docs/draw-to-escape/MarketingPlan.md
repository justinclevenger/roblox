# Draw to Escape --- Marketing & Launch Plan

## Document Overview

This plan covers pre-launch, launch, and post-launch marketing strategy for *Draw to Escape*, a 50-stage obstacle course experience on Roblox where players draw on a 2D canvas and their drawings materialize as 3D physics objects to solve puzzles. All tactics are specific to Roblox's ecosystem and calibrated for the 2025-2026 landscape. The game is free-to-play with monetization through cosmetic drawing materials, star-rating rewards, and zone unlock passes.

**Target audience:** Roblox players aged 8-16 who play obbies (Tower of Hell, Obby Creator), drawing games (Free Draw, DrawIt), and creative/puzzle games (Build a Boat for Treasure). Secondary audience: general Roblox players drawn in by social proof and viral content of creative solutions.

**Core marketing thesis:** The drawing mechanic is inherently viral. Two players solving the same puzzle in wildly different creative ways produces infinite content without any effort from the studio. A player who builds a careful staircase and a player who draws a giant hand to slap themselves across a gap are both valid solutions --- and the contrast is endlessly shareable. The marketing strategy is built around *showing real player solutions* and letting the creativity, comedy, and chaos do the work. Every piece of marketing should answer one question: "What would YOU draw?"

## 1. Pre-Launch Phase (Weeks -4 to -1)

### 1.1 Teaser Content Strategy

The goal of pre-launch is to communicate two things: (1) you can draw anything, and (2) it comes to life in 3D. Unlike horror marketing where mystery drives anticipation, Draw to Escape marketing should be immediately comprehensible. A viewer should understand the mechanic within 3 seconds of any clip. Curiosity comes from wondering what solutions are possible, not from what the game is.

#### What to Show

| Content Type | Details | When |
|---|---|---|
| Core mechanic reveal | A single 15-second clip: player draws a bridge on the 2D canvas, camera pulls back, the bridge materializes in 3D, player walks across a gap. Clean, satisfying, unmistakable. | Week -4 |
| "Same puzzle, different answers" | Side-by-side split screen: three players solve the same stage in completely different ways. One draws a ramp, one draws a catapult, one draws a stick figure and rides it. | Week -4 |
| Material showcase | Short clips showing the same drawing made with different materials: bouncy rubber, slippery ice, sticky goo, heavy metal. Each behaves differently with physics. | Week -3 |
| Death jumpscare supercut | Rapid-fire compilation of 6-8 failed attempts with jumpscare death animations. Quick cuts, escalating absurdity. End with text: "50 stages. Can you draw your way out?" | Week -3 |
| Zone previews | 10-second clips of each themed zone: Pencil Plains, Crayon Canyon, Marker Maze, Watercolor Falls, Chalk Cliffs, Neon City, Ink Abyss, Paint Splatter Summit, Digital Grid, The Gallery. Stylized, vibrant, distinct. | Week -2 |
| Gameplay trailer (60-90s) | Full trailer showing the draw-materialize-solve loop across multiple zones. Feature creative solutions, death reactions, star ratings, material unlocks. End with "What will YOU draw?" | Week -2 |
| "Impossible stage" teaser | Show a late-game rage-quit stage (Zone 8-9 difficulty). No solution shown. Just the obstacle. Text: "Good luck." | Week -1 |

#### What to Hold Back

- **Zones 7-10 solutions.** Show the environments but never reveal how to solve late-game stages. Let players and creators discover these on camera. The moment someone figures out Stage 47 will be a genuine content moment.
- **The Gallery (Zone 10).** The final zone should be a complete surprise. Show no footage. The aesthetic shift (player drawings displayed in a museum-style gallery as they play) is a reward for reaching the end.
- **Sandbox mode.** Do not mention the planned Sandbox mode update (Month 3). Let it be a surprise announcement that reignites interest.
- **Multiplayer co-op.** Do not tease co-op drawing (Month 2 update). The single-player launch should stand on its own.
- **Easter egg drawings.** Certain drawings trigger hidden reactions (drawing a cat produces a meow, drawing specific shapes unlocks secret paths). Let the community discover these.

### 1.2 Platform-Specific Tactics

#### TikTok (Primary Platform)

TikTok is the primary marketing platform for Draw to Escape. The drawing mechanic is tailor-made for short-form vertical video. Every clip is a self-contained story: problem, creative solution, satisfying result (or hilarious failure).

- **Target format:** 15-30 second vertical clips, native captions
- **Content angles:**
  - "What would you draw?" --- Show a stage, pause before the solution, let viewers comment. Post the solution as a follow-up.
  - "Drawing gone wrong" --- Failed drawings that produce absurd physics results. A wonky bridge that collapses, a ramp that launches the player into a wall, a platform that spins.
  - "Galaxy brain" --- Unexpectedly clever solutions. Player draws a simple circle, it rolls downhill, pushes a button, opens a door. Satisfying problem-solving.
  - Death jumpscare reactions --- Face cam + game footage. The jumpscare moment. These are TikTok's bread and butter.
  - Speed drawing --- Time-lapse of an elaborate drawing materializing into a complex 3D structure. Oddly satisfying content.
  - "Nobody expected this to work" --- Absurd drawings (stick figure, random scribble, a word) that somehow solve the puzzle.
- **Hashtags:** #DrawToEscape #RobloxObby #DrawingGame #RobloxGame #CreativeGaming #ObstacleCourse #WhatWouldYouDraw
- **Posting cadence:** 5-7 TikToks per week starting 4 weeks before launch, daily in launch week
- **Sound strategy:** Create a branded sound from the drawing materialization effect (the "whoosh-solidify" when a 2D drawing becomes 3D). This sound is satisfying, distinctive, and usable by other creators. If it catches on as a transition sound, organic reach compounds.

#### YouTube

- **Target format:** 60-90 second trailer, vertical Shorts (15-30s), creator content (10-20 min)
- **Trailer strategy:** Upload the main gameplay trailer. Optimize title: "Draw to Escape - Official Trailer | Draw Anything to Solve Puzzles | Roblox 2026"
- **Shorts:** 5-8 vertical clips pulled from gameplay. Focus on: (1) the most creative solution in each zone, (2) the funniest death, (3) the most satisfying materialization. Use text overlays ("POV: your terrible drawing somehow works")
- **SEO targets:** "new roblox obby 2026," "roblox drawing game," "roblox puzzle game," "roblox creative game," "roblox obby like tower of hell," "roblox build a boat"
- **Community posts:** Use YouTube community tab for "What would you draw?" polls and stage previews

#### Twitter/X

- **Target format:** Short-form text + video, engagement bait, stage previews
- **Content strategy:**
  - Countdown posts starting at 2 weeks out
  - Developer diary threads: "How we built a 2D-to-3D physics engine," "Designing 50 stages that can be solved a million different ways"
  - Engagement posts: "Show me your worst drawing. Now imagine it as a 3D bridge over lava." Polls: "Which material would you use?" with options
  - Retweet and amplify any player/creator content
  - Stage-of-the-day previews showing the obstacle without the solution
- **Cadence:** 1-2 posts per day, 3-4 in launch week

#### Roblox Social Features

- **Roblox Group:** Create the official game group 4 weeks before launch. Post zone previews, development screenshots, and countdowns.
- **Experience page:** Set up early with a "Coming Soon" description, vibrant thumbnail, and icon. Description should communicate the mechanic immediately: "Draw on a 2D canvas. Watch your drawing come to life in 3D. Use it to solve puzzles, cross gaps, climb walls, and escape 50 stages across 10 themed zones. Your creativity is your only tool."
- **Roblox badges:** Pre-configure launch badges: "Day One Artist" (played in first 24 hours), "First Masterpiece" (completed Stage 1), "Speed Sketcher" (3-star rating on any stage).
- **Social links:** Connect Discord, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter/X to the Roblox group page.

### 1.3 Influencer/Content Creator Outreach

Detailed in Section 4 below. In the pre-launch phase:

- **Week -4:** Identify and reach out to Tier 1 and Tier 2 creators (see Section 4.1). Prioritize creators who cover obbies, creative games, and drawing games.
- **Week -3:** Send early access builds to confirmed Tier 1 creators (Zones 1-5 only, under embargo).
- **Week -2:** Lift embargo --- Tier 1 creators publish "first look" videos. Tier 2 creators receive access.
- **Week -1:** Tier 2 creator content starts publishing. Build momentum.
- **Launch day:** Tier 3 (micro) creators get access. All zones unlocked for everyone.

### 1.4 Community Building (Pre-Launch)

- **Discord server:** Launch 4 weeks before release. Structure detailed in Section 5.1.
- **"Design a Stage" contest:** Run a community contest where players submit stage ideas via Discord. The winning design becomes a real stage in the Week 2 update. This gives the community ownership before they have even played.
- **Drawing challenges:** Weekly drawing prompts on Discord and TikTok --- "Draw something that would help you cross a lava pit" --- to build engagement around the core mechanic before launch.
- **Closed playtest:** 1-2 closed playtests via Discord (Zones 1-3, 50-100 players each). Participants get an exclusive "Beta Artist" badge. Dual purpose: QA and community investment.
- **Waitlist / notification:** Encourage players to favorite the experience on Roblox and join the group for launch notification.

## 2. Launch Phase (Launch Week)

### 2.1 Launch Day Tactics

**Timing:** Launch on a Friday afternoon (US time zones). Roblox traffic peaks Friday evening through Sunday. This gives maximum exposure during the first 48 hours, which are critical for algorithmic placement.

**Launch day sequence:**

| Time (US Eastern) | Action |
|---|---|
| 12:00 PM | Experience goes live. Social posts across all platforms: "Draw to Escape is LIVE. 50 stages. 10 zones. What will you draw?" |
| 12:00 PM | Group shout to all members. Discord @everyone announcement with play link. |
| 12:00-2:00 PM | Tier 1 creators go live on YouTube/Twitch (pre-coordinated). First-time blind playthroughs. |
| 1:00 PM | First wave of TikTok launch clips from official account --- rapid-fire creative solutions montage. |
| 2:00-5:00 PM | Tier 2 creators publish videos/streams. Stagger for continuous coverage. |
| 5:00 PM | Sponsored Experiences campaign activates (if budget allows). |
| Evening | Monitor CCU, respond to issues, engage with community. Post "best drawings so far" compilation on social. |
| Saturday | Community event: "10,000 Drawings" milestone tracker on Discord. "Stage 50 Speedrun" challenge opens. |
| Sunday | Highlight reel of best creator reactions and most creative solutions posted across platforms. |

**Launch day content drops:**

- Official launch trailer (final polished version)
- "How to Draw" quick-start guide on the experience description page and Discord (controls, tips, material properties)
- Behind-the-scenes post about the 2D-to-3D materialization system --- now that players can experience it, technical details generate discussion and appreciation
- "Dev Solutions vs. Player Solutions" post: show how the developers expected each stage to be solved alongside the wildest community solutions. This format has high engagement potential.

### 2.2 Roblox-Specific Discovery

#### Sponsored Experiences

- **Campaign timing:** Start on launch day, run for 7-14 days
- **Targeting:** Age 8+, interests: obby, adventure, creative, building, drawing. Target players of Tower of Hell, Obby Creator, Free Draw, Build a Boat for Treasure, Mega Obby, and similar creative/obby experiences
- **Creative:** Use the game thumbnail showing a drawing materializing into 3D. Emphasize the hook: "Draw ANYTHING to solve puzzles. 50 stages. Can you escape?"
- **Budget:** See Section 6 for ranges. Allocate 60% of paid budget to the first 7 days
- **Optimization:** Monitor cost-per-play and session time. Pause underperforming creatives within 48 hours. A/B test at least 3 thumbnail variants. Test "creative" thumbnails (showing a drawing coming to life) against "challenge" thumbnails (showing a difficult stage)

#### Sort Algorithm Optimization

Roblox's Discover page is driven by engagement metrics. The goal is to signal quality to the algorithm in the first 48 hours:

- **Session time:** The 50-stage progression with 3-star ratings creates natural 20-40 minute sessions as players push "one more stage." Puzzle games that deliver frequent small dopamine hits (solving a stage, earning a star) retain session time.
- **Return rate:** Star ratings and missed stars create a natural "I'll come back and 3-star that stage" pull. Material unlocks gate progression rewards behind returning. Track Day 1 retention obsessively.
- **Social signals:** The drawing mechanic is inherently social --- players want to show friends their solutions and see how friends approach the same stage. The game generates conversation even outside the game.
- **Favorites and thumbs up:** Prompt for a favorite/like after the player completes Zone 1 (Stage 5). They have experienced the full loop by then and can make an informed judgment. Never prompt during gameplay or on death screens.
- **Roblox Search:** Ensure the experience title, description, and tags include "obby," "drawing," "puzzle," "creative," "obstacle course," "physics," and "escape." Roblox search is keyword-driven.

#### Social Features

- **Invite prompts:** After completing a zone, show a "Challenge your friends" prompt that sends Roblox invites with the player's star count for that zone.
- **Share button:** After completing a stage, offer a one-tap share to Roblox feed with a snapshot of the player's drawing and their completion stats (time, stars, material used). A picture of someone's absurd drawing is inherently engaging social content.
- **Stage replays:** Save a ghost replay of the player's solution. When friends play the same stage, they can watch the ghost replay afterward. This drives organic "how did YOU solve it?" conversations.

### 2.3 Content Creator Coordination (Launch Week)

- All Tier 1 creators go live or publish within the first 6 hours. Coordinate to stagger start times for continuous coverage.
- Encourage blind playthroughs --- the first reaction to a drawing materializing in 3D is the content moment. Do not over-brief creators on solutions.
- Provide creators with a "Zone 6-10 preview" clip they can show at the end of their video ("Wait until you see what comes next...") --- this drives viewer demand to continue watching the series.
- Encourage creators to compare their solutions --- "Creator A drew a ramp, Creator B drew a catapult, Creator C drew a literal hand." The comparison format is highly shareable.
- Suggest creators challenge each other: "Can you solve Stage 20 with a single line?" Constraint challenges generate compelling content.
- Prepare a "wildest community solutions" compilation from launch day to post on official channels within 48 hours.

### 2.4 Community Events (Launch Week)

| Event | Description | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| First Escape Race | First 100 players to complete all 50 stages get an exclusive badge | "Escape Artist" badge + exclusive "Gold Ink" material |
| Community Drawing Counter | Track total drawings created across all servers. Hit 100,000 drawings for a community reward. | Exclusive "Rainbow" material unlocked for all players |
| Star Collector Challenge | First player to earn all 150 stars (3 stars x 50 stages) | Leaderboard badge + Discord "Perfectionist" role |
| Ugliest Drawing Contest | Submit the ugliest drawing that still solves the puzzle. Community votes on Discord. | Featured on official social accounts + exclusive "Scribble" trail effect |
| Speedrun Challenge | Fastest full-game completion (all 50 stages) posted to Discord | "Speed Sketcher" badge + leaderboard position |
| Creative Solution Showcase | Most creative solution to any stage, voted by community | Drawing displayed permanently in The Gallery (Zone 10) |

---

## 3. Post-Launch Growth (Months 1-6)

### 3.1 Retention Strategies

Obby and puzzle games on Roblox follow a characteristic pattern: strong initial engagement driven by progression, a natural drop after players complete available content, then stabilization around replayability features. The goal is to ensure the content pipeline never runs dry and that completion does not mean the end.

**Week 1-2 retention drivers:**
- 50 stages with 3-star ratings means most players will not 3-star everything on their first pass. The rating system creates immediate replay motivation.
- 9 unlockable materials gate certain solutions --- players return to re-attempt stages with new materials (a stage impossible with wood becomes trivial with bouncy rubber).
- Progressive difficulty creates a natural "one more stage" pull. Zones 1-3 are accessible. Zones 4-6 require thought. Zones 7-9 require precision and creativity. Zone 10 requires mastery.
- Jumpscare death animations are content moments that players want to experience and share, counterintuitively reducing ragequit rates by making failure entertaining.

**Month 1-3 retention drivers:**
- Artist Update (Week 2) adds new drawing tools and a custom color palette, giving players reasons to revisit stages with new creative options.
- Community Stages (Month 1) adds Zone 11 with 5 community-designed stages, establishing a content pipeline driven by players themselves.
- Multiplayer Co-op (Month 2) transforms every stage into a new experience --- two players drawing together to solve puzzles creates entirely new solution spaces.
- Sandbox Mode (Month 3) provides an infinite creative outlet. Players can build anything with no objectives. This captures the Free Draw/Build a Boat audience permanently.
- Weekly challenges with rotating constraints ("solve 5 stages using only circles," "complete Zone 3 using only the ice material").

**Month 4-6 retention drivers:**
- Competitive mode (Month 4) adds head-to-head racing: two players, same stage, who solves it first. New progression track, ranked leaderboards.
- Seasonal events drive return spikes (see 3.3).
- Community stage submissions become a steady content pipeline, with monthly curated additions.
- Material crafting system (Month 5) lets players combine materials for hybrid properties, unlocking new solution strategies for every existing stage.
- Creator tools (Month 6) let players build and publish their own stages, transforming Draw to Escape from a game into a platform.

### 3.2 Content Update Cadence

| Timing | Update | Marketing Angle |
|---|---|---|
| Week 2 | **Artist Update**: new drawing tools (curved lines, fill tool, eraser), custom color palette, 2 new materials (Glass, Magnet) | "New tools. New solutions. Redraw everything." |
| Week 3-4 | Balance patch + QA fixes based on player data | Dev blog: "Your drawings surprised us --- the 10 solutions we never expected" (showcase community creativity) |
| Month 1 | **Zone 11: Community Stages** --- 5 stages designed from player submissions | "YOU designed these stages. Now try to beat them." Community ownership angle. |
| Month 2 | **Multiplayer Co-op** --- 2-player cooperative drawing on shared canvas | Major marketing push: "Two pencils are better than one." New trailer. Creator collab content. |
| Month 3 | **Sandbox Mode** --- infinite canvas, no objectives, shareable creations | "No puzzles. No timer. Just draw." Targets creative/building audience. |
| Month 4 | **Versus Mode** --- head-to-head stage racing with ranked leaderboards | "Race to solve. Compete to create." Competitive content angle. |
| Month 5 | **Material Lab** --- material crafting system, 5 new hybrid materials | "Combine materials. Break every stage." Replayability driver for veterans. |
| Month 6 | **Stage Creator** --- full stage builder with community publishing | Second launch event. "Build. Share. Challenge the world." Transforms the game into a platform. |

### 3.3 Seasonal Event Marketing

| Event | Timing | Marketing Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Spring Art Festival** | March-April (2-week event) | Pastel-themed zones, flower materials, "draw a garden" community challenge. Exclusive spring cosmetics (flower trail, pastel pencil). Light, colorful marketing. |
| **Summer Splash** | June-July (2-week event) | Water-themed stages, new Liquid material. Beach zone reskin. "Draw a boat" challenge. Aligns with school break traffic spike. Full marketing push. |
| **Back to School** | August-September (1-week event) | School supply themed: notebook paper canvas, ruler tool, chalk material. "Draw your way out of class." Targets the back-to-school Roblox traffic surge. |
| **Halloween Haunt** | October (2-week event) | Spooky zone reskins, amplified jumpscare death animations, exclusive "Glow-in-the-dark" material. Horror crossover tone. Content creators get early access to the jumpscares. Full marketing push: trailer, TikTok, sponsored experiences. |
| **Holiday Workshop** | December (2-week event) | Gift-wrapped stages, snow material, holiday decorations as drawing elements. Lighter tone. "Draw a present for your friends" sharing mechanic. |
| **Anniversary** | Launch month +1 year | Retrospective trailer. Community milestone celebration. "Player's Choice" --- community votes on best community stage, best drawing, most creative solution of the year. Exclusive "Year One" pencil skin. |
| **Community Milestones** | Ongoing | Track cumulative drawings created, stages completed, total stars earned. Hit milestones, unlock community rewards. "The community has drawn 10 million objects. New material unlocked for everyone." |

### 3.4 User-Generated Content & Community Engagement

- **Drawing showcases:** Daily "Drawing of the Day" spotlight on Discord and social media. Feature the most creative, funniest, or most unexpected solution to any stage. This is the game's single most powerful organic marketing tool --- every showcase is a mini-advertisement for the core mechanic.
- **Speedrun leaderboards:** Official leaderboards per stage and full-game. Speedrun content is highly watchable and drives organic YouTube/TikTok content. Speedrunners in Draw to Escape have an additional layer: optimizing the drawing itself for speed (minimum viable drawing to solve the puzzle).
- **Community stage pipeline:** Monthly community stage design contest. Top 5 submissions (as voted by the community) get built into the game. Designers get in-game credit and an exclusive "Stage Designer" badge. This creates a perpetual content engine.
- **"Same Stage, 100 Solutions" compilations:** Periodically compile the most diverse solutions to a single stage into a video. This format is inherently viral --- it communicates the game's depth and creativity in a single piece of content.
- **Fan art crossover:** Encourage players to draw fan art FROM within the game (using the drawing canvas to create art, then screenshotting it). Host weekly fan art contests. This conflates playing the game with creating shareable art.
- **Strategy and creativity guides encouraged:** When players share optimal drawing techniques, material synergies, and creative shortcuts, amplify them. This content drives discovery and makes the game feel deep.

### 3.5 Cross-Promotion Opportunities

- **Other Roblox obby/creative games:** Reach out to developers of Tower of Hell, Obby Creator, and Build a Boat for Treasure for mutual promotion. In-game portals, social media shoutouts, or collaborative events ("The Crossover Challenge" --- solve their obstacles with your drawings).
- **Roblox events:** Participate in Roblox-organized events (Innovation Awards, seasonal platform events, The Hunt). These provide visibility to the broader Roblox audience. Draw to Escape's creative mechanic is well-suited for event integration (draw-themed event challenges).
- **Education angle:** The drawing-to-physics mechanic has inherent STEM appeal (spatial reasoning, physics, creative problem-solving). Pursue Roblox Education partnerships or classroom integration features. This is a unique positioning advantage over pure-entertainment obbies.
- **Art tool tie-ins:** If a major drawing app, tablet manufacturer, or art supply brand wants to reach young audiences, Draw to Escape is a natural fit. Branded materials or tools (e.g., "Crayola Crayon" material pack) are non-intrusive and thematic.
- **Roblox Creator Marketplace:** Release a "Drawing Canvas" module on the Creator Marketplace. Other developers integrating the drawing mechanic into their games creates brand awareness and positions Draw to Escape as the originator.

## 4. Content Creator Strategy

### 4.1 Creator Tier System

| Tier | Audience Size | Estimated Count to Target | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 --- Mega Creators** | 500K+ subscribers/followers | 3-5 creators | Launch day headliners. Drive initial awareness spike. Their blind playthrough reactions to the drawing mechanic become the first impression for millions. |
| **Tier 2 --- Mid Creators** | 50K-500K subscribers/followers | 10-20 creators | Sustained coverage in launch week. Full zone playthroughs, creative solution showcases, challenge videos. More engaged audiences with higher conversion rates. |
| **Tier 3 --- Micro Creators** | 5K-50K subscribers/followers | 30-50+ creators | Long-tail coverage. Niche obby and creative game communities. High engagement rates. Community trust. |

#### Tier 1 Targets (Roblox Creative/Obby Creators)

Identify and prioritize creators who regularly cover Roblox obbies, creative games, or drawing games. Key profiles to pursue:

- Roblox obby YouTubers with 500K+ subs who covered Tower of Hell, Obby Creator, or similar at launch
- General Roblox YouTubers (1M+) who cover new experiences and challenges
- Creative/building game YouTubers who covered Build a Boat for Treasure, Free Draw, or similar
- TikTok creators (500K+) who post Roblox gameplay clips, especially satisfying/creative content
- Family-friendly Roblox creators whose audience skews 8-12 (the core demographic)

#### Tier 2 Targets

- Roblox-focused YouTube channels (50K-500K) that cover new experiences regularly
- Art and drawing content creators who do not normally cover Roblox (the creative mechanic may pull them in)
- Roblox group/clan leaders with large, active communities
- Spanish-language and Portuguese-language Roblox creators (large international Roblox audiences)
- Family/kid-friendly gaming channels that feature Roblox content

#### Tier 3 Targets

- Small Roblox obby and creative game YouTubers and TikTokers
- Discord community moderators with active gaming servers
- Reddit users active in r/roblox and gaming subreddits
- Roblox fan wiki editors and community members
- Art and drawing community creators on TikTok who might try the game for crossover content

### 4.2 What to Provide Creators

| Tier | Early Access | Exclusive Content | Compensation | Expectations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | 2 weeks before launch (Zones 1-5 only, under embargo) | Exclusive Zone 6-10 preview clip (30s). Custom in-game badge ("Drew with [creator name]"). Private dev session showing advanced drawing techniques. | Negotiate per creator. Options: flat fee, revenue share on referred cosmetic purchases, or Robux equivalent. Budget 300-1,500 USD equivalent per Tier 1 creator. | 1 dedicated video (10+ min) OR 1 livestream (1+ hour) within first 48 hours of launch |
| **Tier 2** | 3-5 days before launch (Zones 1-5) | Promo codes for 5-10 exclusive material packs to give away. In-game "Creator" badge. Early access to one unreleased material. | Promo code giveaways only (no direct payment). The game and audience access is the value proposition. | 1 video or stream within launch week |
| **Tier 3** | Launch day (no early access) | 2-3 material pack promo codes for giveaways | No direct compensation. Badge + codes only. | No hard expectations. Provide assets and hope for organic coverage. |

### 4.3 Creative-Game Content Angles by Platform

#### YouTube (Long-Form)

Angles that perform well for Roblox creative/obby content on YouTube:

- **"This game lets you DRAW your way out"** --- The mechanic explanation angle. Position Draw to Escape as something genuinely new. The 2D-to-3D materialization is visually impressive and immediately understandable in a thumbnail (before/after: flat drawing -> 3D object).
- **Full blind playthrough** --- Unedited or lightly edited first-time runs through all 10 zones. The genuine discovery of how different materials behave, the escalating difficulty, and the death jumpscares are the content. Do not brief creators on solutions.
- **"Can I beat it by drawing only [constraint]?"** --- Challenge format. "Can I beat Draw to Escape by only drawing circles?" "What if I only use the ice material?" Constraint challenges are YouTube's most reliable gaming format.
- **"My drawing vs. the intended solution"** --- Show the player's chaotic drawing next to an elegant solution. The contrast between a stick figure bridge and an engineering marvel is inherently entertaining.
- **Rage stages compilation** --- Zones 8-9 difficulty spikes produce frustration content that is highly watchable (Geometry Dash, Getting Over It energy). The jumpscare death animations add a unique twist.
- **Creative solutions supercut** --- "50 stages in 10 minutes" montage showing the player's solution to every stage. Fast-paced, satisfying, showcases the game's variety.

#### TikTok (Short-Form)

- **Drawing materialization clips** --- 10-15 seconds. The moment a 2D drawing becomes a 3D object. This is inherently satisfying content (oddly satisfying, ASMR-adjacent) and can trend on its own visual merit.
- **Death jumpscare reactions** --- Face cam + game footage. The unexpected jumpscare on a failed attempt. Reaction content drives engagement on TikTok.
- **"What would you draw?"** --- Show a stage, pause. Ask viewers to comment their solution. This format drives comments (algorithm signal) and can be serialized infinitely.
- **"Galaxy brain" solutions** --- A seemingly impossible stage solved with an absurdly simple drawing. The "wait, that works?" moment.
- **Side-by-side comparisons** --- Split screen of two different solutions to the same stage. Duet-bait format.
- **Speed drawing** --- Time-lapse of an elaborate drawing from the 2D canvas. Satisfying art content that also advertises the game.
- **"Drawing [thing] to solve [stage]"** --- Drawing a recognizable object (a car, a dinosaur, a house) that technically solves the puzzle despite being absurd.

#### Twitch (Live)

- **First playthrough streams** --- The genuine, unscripted reaction to the drawing mechanic and the escalating difficulty. The chat can suggest drawings, creating interactive content.
- **"Chat draws, I play"** --- Chat votes on or suggests what the streamer must draw for each stage. Interactive format that drives chat engagement.
- **Race format** --- Two streamers race through stages simultaneously. Split-screen. Different solutions. Competitive energy.
- **"No eraser" challenge** --- Streamer must commit to every drawing, no corrections. Produces chaotic, entertaining results.
- **Community play sessions** --- When co-op launches (Month 2), streamer plays with viewers. Collaborative drawing produces natural comedy.

### 4.4 Roblox-Specific Creator Programs

- **Roblox Star Creator Program:** If any targeted creators are in the Roblox Star program, their coverage carries additional weight (Star creators get algorithmic boosts on the platform). Prioritize these creators.
- **Roblox Video Stars:** Creators in this program can create in-game Star Creator items. A co-branded drawing material or pencil skin tied to a Star Creator drives mutual promotion.
- **Creator Marketplace:** Consider creating a "Creator Kit" on the Roblox Creator Marketplace with promotional assets (thumbnails, drawing canvas screenshots, material showcase clips, logos) that creators can use in their own content.
- **Family-friendly advantage:** Unlike horror games, Draw to Escape is suitable for all Roblox ages. This means every Roblox creator is a potential partner, not just niche genre creators. The addressable creator market is significantly larger.

#### Roles

- **Developer** --- Dev team members
- **Moderator** --- Community moderators
- **Content Creator** --- Verified YouTubers, TikTokers, streamers
- **Beta Artist** --- Pre-launch playtest participants
- **Day One** --- Players who joined the Discord before launch
- **Escape Artist** --- Players who completed all 50 stages
- **Perfectionist** --- Players who earned all 150 stars (3 stars on every stage)
- **Stage Designer** --- Players whose stage submissions were added to the game
- **Speed Sketcher** --- Players who hold or have held a speedrun record
- Zone completion roles for each of the 10 zones

#### Moderation

- Enforce spoiler tags for Zone 5+ solutions in general channels
- Auto-mod for inappropriate content, spam, and self-promotion outside designated channels
- Family-friendly server --- stricter moderation than typical gaming Discords given the 8-16 core demographic
- Ticket system for bug reports and appeals
- 2-3 volunteer moderators recruited from the playtest community
- Age-appropriate content guidelines clearly posted and enforced

### 5.2 Roblox Group Features

- **Group name:** "Draw to Escape Official"
- **Group description:** Mechanic-forward: "Draw on a 2D canvas. Watch it come to life in 3D. Solve 50 stages across 10 themed zones. Your creativity is your only tool. What will you draw?"
- **Group wall:** Weekly updates, event announcements, community milestones, "Drawing of the Week" spotlight
- **Group shouts:** Major announcements only (launch, major updates, seasonal events). Do not overuse --- players mute groups that shout too often.
- **Group ranks:** Visitor (default), Sketcher (joined group), Artist (completed Zone 5), Master Artist (completed all 50 stages), Stage Designer (community stage creator), Staff (dev team)
- **Group store:** Sell group-exclusive cosmetic items (group T-shirt with Draw to Escape art, group pencil skin)

### 5.3 Community Challenges & Events (Ongoing)

Unlike a lore-driven ARG, Draw to Escape's community engagement centers on creativity and competition. The game mechanic itself generates content --- the community layer amplifies it.

#### Weekly Challenges

- **Constraint Challenge:** Every Monday, post a new constraint: "This week, solve 5 stages using only straight lines" or "Complete Zone 3 using only the rubber material." Completions earn a Discord role for the week and entry into a monthly prize drawing.
- **Drawing Prompt:** Every Wednesday, post a creative prompt: "Draw a vehicle that could cross Stage 22." Players submit screenshots. Community votes on the most creative. Winner gets featured on social media.
- **Speedrun of the Week:** Every Friday, designate a single stage as the speedrun target. Fastest verified time by Sunday gets a Discord role and leaderboard mention.

#### Monthly Events

- **Stage Design Contest:** Open submissions for community-designed stages. Top 5 get built into the game in the next update. Designers get permanent in-game credit.
- **"Rube Goldberg" Challenge:** Design the most unnecessarily complex solution to a simple stage. Community votes. Winner gets a custom drawing material.
- **Material Mastery:** Each month, spotlight one material. Players compete to find the most creative uses. Best clips compiled into an official video.

#### Milestone Celebrations

- 100K total drawings created: Community unlocks "Confetti" particle effect for completed stages
- 1M total drawings created: Community unlocks "Holographic" material
- 10M total drawings created: Community unlocks the "Infinite Canvas" sandbox expansion
- Track and celebrate per-stage milestones: "Stage 47 has been solved 10,000 times --- here are the 10 most creative solutions"

### 5.4 User Feedback Loops

- **Bug reports:** Structured template in Discord (#bug-reports) and an in-game report button. Given the physics-based nature of the game, expect creative edge cases ("my drawing clipped through the wall and I fell into the void").
- **Stage difficulty feedback:** Track per-stage completion rates. If a stage has below 10% completion rate after 1,000 attempts, flag it for difficulty review. Share anonymized difficulty data with the community via dev blogs.
- **Suggestion voting:** Monthly community polls on Discord for prioritizing requested features (curated list --- do not run open polls that create undeliverable expectations).
- **Drawing analytics:** Track what players draw most often (shapes, sizes, materials used). Share fun statistics: "The most commonly drawn shape is a rectangle. The least commonly drawn material is ice. The average drawing has 12 strokes." This data makes great social media content.
- **Response time commitment:** Acknowledge bugs within 24 hours on Discord. Fix critical issues (physics exploits, stage-breaking bugs) within 48 hours. Non-critical fixes on a weekly patch cadence.

## 6. Budget Considerations

### 6.1 Roblox Sponsored Experiences

Sponsored Experiences costs vary by targeting, competition, and time of year. Based on 2025-2026 Roblox advertising benchmarks:

| Budget Tier | Daily Spend | Campaign Duration | Expected Plays | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Minimum Viable** | 50-100 USD/day | 7 days | 15K-40K plays | Enough to seed initial discovery. Family-friendly content tends to have lower CPP than horror. Relies heavily on organic growth. |
| **Moderate** | 200-500 USD/day | 14 days | 60K-200K plays | Solid launch push. Allows A/B testing of creatives. Recommended starting point. |
| **Aggressive** | 1,000-2,000 USD/day | 14-30 days | 250K-600K+ plays | For maximum launch impact. The broader age targeting (8+) means larger addressable audience than niche genres. |

**Optimization tips:**
- Start with the moderate tier. Scale up if Day 1 session time exceeds 15 minutes and return rate exceeds 20%.
- Front-load budget: 60% of total spend in the first 7 days, 40% in days 8-14.
- A/B test at least 3 ad thumbnails. For creative games, bright, colorful thumbnails with a clear before/after (2D drawing -> 3D object) outperform dark or text-heavy alternatives.
- Target players who have recently played competing obby and creative experiences for highest engagement.
- Pause and reassess if cost-per-play exceeds 0.08 USD consistently. Family-friendly games targeting younger demographics typically achieve lower CPP than niche genres.
- Consider retargeting: players who played but did not complete Zone 1 may respond to "Come back and finish your drawing" messaging.

### 6.2 Creator Compensation Tiers

| Tier | Compensation Model | Estimated Cost Per Creator | Total Budget (estimated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 (3-5 creators)** | Flat fee OR revenue share on referred cosmetic purchases | 300-1,500 USD equivalent per creator | 900-7,500 USD |
| **Tier 2 (10-20 creators)** | Promo codes only (5-10 material pack codes each, cost to dev is zero since these are digital goods) | 0 USD cash | 0 USD cash |
| **Tier 3 (30-50 creators)** | 2-3 promo codes each + badge | 0 USD cash | 0 USD cash |

**Notes on creator economics:**
- Draw to Escape's family-friendly nature means a wider range of creators are willing to cover it compared to niche horror. Many general Roblox creators in the 50K-500K range will cover a visually interesting game without payment if given early access.
- The drawing mechanic provides inherent content value --- the clip of a drawing materializing is a thumbnail-worthy moment. Creators benefit from covering the game regardless of payment.
- Tier 1 creators with 1M+ subscribers may require payment. Negotiate based on expected video views, not subscriber count.
- Never pay for guaranteed positive coverage. Pay for access and exposure; let the game quality speak for itself.
- Track creator-driven installs via custom badges or referral codes where possible.
- Family-friendly creators often have higher CPM rates (advertisers pay more for kid-friendly audiences), meaning they may accept lower flat fees since the content monetizes well for them.

### 6.3 Organic vs. Paid Split Recommendations

| Phase | Organic | Paid | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-Launch** | 90% | 10% | Build community and creator relationships organically. Minimal paid spend (boosted social posts only). The drawing mechanic clips are strong enough to grow organically on TikTok. |
| **Launch Week** | 40% | 60% | Maximum paid push to accelerate algorithmic momentum. The game's visual hook (drawing -> 3D) converts well in ads. Once the algorithm picks up the game, organic takes over. |
| **Month 1** | 55% | 45% | Sustained paid spend through the Co-op update (Month 2) and Sandbox Mode (Month 3) to capture the full addressable audience. |
| **Months 2-6** | 80% | 20% | Paid spend limited to update launches and seasonal events. Community-generated content (solution clips, challenge videos) should drive organic baseline. |
| **Ongoing** | 85-90% | 10-15% | Maintenance spend. Spike for major updates (Stage Creator launch at Month 6 should get a full paid push). |

### 6.4 Total Budget Ranges

| Scenario | First-Month Budget | 6-Month Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | 500-2,000 USD | 2,500-7,000 USD | No Tier 1 creator payments. Minimal sponsored experiences. Relies on the drawing mechanic's inherent virality and TikTok organic reach. Viable if the materialization effect is genuinely satisfying and the first 10 stages are polished. |
| **Moderate** | 4,000-12,000 USD | 15,000-40,000 USD | 2-3 paid Tier 1 creators. 14-day sponsored experience campaign. Paid pushes for Co-op and Sandbox updates. Recommended for most indie Roblox studios. |
| **Aggressive** | 15,000-40,000 USD | 60,000-120,000 USD | Full Tier 1 creator roster. 30-day aggressive sponsored experience campaign. Paid TikTok and YouTube ads. Only justified if studio has funding and Day 1 metrics confirm strong conversion. |

## 7. KPIs and Success Metrics

### 7.1 Launch Targets (First 7 Days)

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total plays (unique players) | 30,000 | 150,000 | 750,000+ |
| Peak concurrent users (CCU) | 500 | 3,000 | 15,000+ |
| Average session time | 15 min | 22 min | 28+ min |
| Zone 1 (Stages 1-5) completion rate | 60% | 75% | 85%+ |
| Zone 5 (Stage 25) reach rate | 15% | 25% | 35%+ |
| Full game completion rate (all 50 stages) | 3% | 7% | 12%+ |
| Thumbs up ratio | 70%+ | 80%+ | 88%+ |
| Discord members | 1,500 | 4,000 | 12,000+ |
| Roblox Group members | 5,000 | 25,000 | 100,000+ |

### 7.2 Retention Benchmarks

Roblox obby and creative game retention benchmarks (based on genre analysis of top-performing titles in 2024-2025):

| Metric | Below Average | Average | Good | Excellent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Day 1 retention** (return within 24 hours) | <12% | 12-20% | 20-30% | 30%+ |
| **Day 7 retention** | <4% | 4-8% | 8-15% | 15%+ |
| **Day 30 retention** | <2% | 2-4% | 4-8% | 8%+ |
| **Session frequency** (sessions per week, active players) | 1-2 | 2-3 | 3-5 | 5+ |
| **Zone 1 completion rate** | 40% | 55% | 70% | 80%+ |

**Draw to Escape's retention advantages:**
- Star ratings create replay motivation beyond simple completion (the "I can 3-star that" pull)
- 9 unlockable materials gate new strategies behind progression, making replay mechanically different
- Progressive difficulty (tutorial to rage-quit) means players at different skill levels hit their "wall" at different points, creating a staggered return pattern as they improve
- Jumpscare death animations make failure entertaining rather than frustrating, reducing ragequit rates
- The drawing mechanic means no two attempts look the same --- even the player's own repeat attempts use different drawings
- Content updates (co-op, sandbox, versus, stage creator) provide distinct reasons to return every month

**Retention red flags to watch:**
- Zone 1 completion rate below 50% --- the tutorial stages are too confusing or the drawing controls are not intuitive. Simplify onboarding immediately.
- Day 1 retention below 12% --- the core loop (draw, materialize, solve) is not landing. Investigate whether the materialization effect is satisfying enough or if physics behavior is too unpredictable.
- Stage 6-10 completion rate drops below 30% of Stage 5 completers --- the difficulty cliff between Zone 1 (tutorial) and Zone 2 is too steep. Add intermediate stages.
- Average session time below 10 minutes --- players are not getting hooked. Check if the star rating system is communicating value and if material unlocks are spaced correctly.

### 7.3 Revenue Milestones

Draw to Escape monetizes through cosmetic purchases (drawing materials, pencil skins, canvas themes, trail effects) and zone unlock passes. Based on Roblox developer revenue (after Roblox's ~75% platform cut for in-experience purchases, actual developer payout is approximately 25% of Robux spent):

| Milestone | Robux Earned (Gross) | Developer Payout (est.) | Timing Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Break even on moderate marketing budget** | 1.5M-5M Robux | 4,000-12,000 USD | Month 1-2 |
| **Sustainable** (covers ongoing development) | 8M-16M Robux | 20,000-40,000 USD | Month 3-4 |
| **Success** (profitable, funds next project) | 40M-80M Robux | 100,000-200,000 USD | Month 6-12 |
| **Breakout hit** | 150M+ Robux | 375,000+ USD | Year 1 |

**Revenue tracking priorities:**
- Cosmetic material purchase rate (primary revenue driver --- what percentage of players buy at least one material)
- ARPPU (average revenue per paying user) --- target 200-400 Robux
- Premium subscriber engagement minutes (passive revenue from Roblox Premium payouts --- this can be significant at scale for games with long session times)
- Seasonal event cosmetic attach rate (measure spike in purchases during events)
- Zone unlock pass conversion (if implemented --- what percentage of players buy ahead vs. earn through gameplay)
- Stage Creator monetization (Month 6+): track if user-generated stages drive retention and by extension revenue

### 7.4 Content & Community KPIs

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 6) |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube videos about Draw to Escape | 75+ | 750+ |
| TikTok videos with game hashtag | 500+ | 5,000+ |
| Discord active members (weekly) | 2,000+ | 8,000+ |
| Roblox Group members | 25,000+ | 150,000+ |
| Community stage submissions | 50+ | 500+ |
| Unique drawings created (total) | 500,000+ | 10,000,000+ |
| Speedrun records submitted | 20+ | 200+ |
| Creator videos/streams (all tiers) | 50+ | 300+ |
| "Drawing of the Day" submissions | 100+ | 500+ |
| Fan wiki pages (if community creates one) | 15+ | 80+ |

**Content KPI context:** Draw to Escape has a structural advantage over most Roblox games for content generation. Every player's solution is unique, which means every player's gameplay footage is unique. The "same stage, different answers" dynamic means content never feels repetitive. TikTok targets are set higher than comparable games because the drawing mechanic produces inherently short-form, shareable clips without any editing required.

## 8. Creative Marketing Playbook

This section consolidates the highest-impact creative marketing ideas into an actionable playbook. These tactics go beyond standard influencer campaigns and sponsored experiences --- they are designed to make Draw to Escape culturally unavoidable. Each idea leverages the game's core strength: the drawing mechanic produces infinite unique content, comedy, and shareable moments without any effort from the studio.

The ideas are organized by category, with implementation details, effort levels, and timing. The section concludes with a priority matrix that ranks all ideas for sequencing.

**Effort scale:**
- **Low** --- Can be executed by 1-2 people in under a week with no engineering work
- **Medium** --- Requires 1-2 weeks of coordinated effort across design, engineering, or external partners
- **High** --- Requires significant engineering, partnerships, or multi-week production

**Timing categories:**
- **Pre-Launch** --- Weeks -4 to -1
- **Launch** --- Launch week
- **Month 1-2** --- Early post-launch
- **Month 3-6** --- Growth phase
- **Ongoing** --- Repeating or evergreen

### 8.1 Guerrilla & Grassroots

Unconventional, low-cost, high-attention tactics that create organic discovery and word-of-mouth outside traditional Roblox marketing channels.

| # | Idea | Description | Why It Works | Effort | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"The Unsolvable Drawing" ARG** | Hide encoded coordinates inside a cryptic drawing shared on social media. The coordinates decode to in-game clues that lead to a secret room accessible only through a specific sequence of drawings across 3 stages. Document nothing --- let the community discover it. | ARGs create obsessive community engagement. The drawing mechanic means the clues are visual, not text-based, which is more accessible for the 8-16 audience and more shareable on TikTok. The secret room becomes legendary content when someone finally finds it. | Medium | Month 1-2 |
| 2 | **"Draw the Bridge" Classroom Challenge** | Create a free STEM worksheet where students must design a bridge on a 2D grid that could support a character crossing a gap. The worksheet teaches structural physics concepts and includes a QR code linking to Draw to Escape where they can test their design. Distribute through teacher communities on Reddit, Facebook groups, and Teachers Pay Teachers. | Disguises marketing as educational content. Teachers share useful resources organically. Parents see the game as educational rather than time-wasting. The worksheet-to-game pipeline is a natural funnel that no competitor is exploiting. | Low | Pre-Launch |
| 3 | **"The Worst Drawing Wins" Anti-Talent Show** | Weekly in-game event where the ugliest, most absurd drawing that still successfully solves a designated stage wins an exclusive cosmetic. Community votes on Discord. The winner's drawing is displayed in The Gallery (Zone 10) for the following week. | Inverts the skill barrier --- bad artists feel welcomed, not excluded. The comedy of terrible drawings that somehow work is the game's most shareable content format. Lowers intimidation for new players who think they "can't draw." | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 4 | **"Rage Quit Receipt"** | When a player dies 10+ times on a single stage, generate a shareable "death certificate" image: their worst drawing, number of deaths, time wasted, cause of death, and a QR code linking to the game. Styled like a medical examiner's report. One-tap share to social media. | Failure content outperforms success content on social media. Players share their suffering as a badge of honor. The QR code turns every rage-share into a player acquisition funnel. The death certificate format is inherently meme-able and screenshot-worthy. | Medium | Launch |
| 5 | **"Draw to Escape IRL" Sidewalk Chalk Campaign** | Encourage superfans to draw game obstacles on sidewalks with chalk, along with a QR code and "Can you draw your way past this?" message. Provide a downloadable stencil kit on Discord. Feature the best real-world chalk drawings on official social media. | Bridges the digital-physical gap at zero cost. Chalk art is inherently eye-catching and temporary, creating urgency. Fan-driven street marketing scales without budget. The stencil kit makes participation easy and ensures brand consistency. | Low | Month 1-2 |
| 6 | **"Physics Physicist" Science TikTok Bait** | Invite science and physics TikTok creators (not gaming creators) to audit Draw to Escape's physics accuracy. "Is this bridge structurally sound?" "Would this ramp actually launch you that far?" Frame it as a science experiment, not a game ad. | Reaches audiences who would never encounter a Roblox ad. Science content creators have massive, engaged audiences (10M+ followers in aggregate). The "is the physics real?" question is inherently interesting content regardless of the answer. Cross-genre discovery. | Low | Month 1-2 |
| 7 | **"The Forbidden Stage" Whisper Campaign** | Seed rumors across Discord, Reddit, and TikTok comments about a "Stage 51" that was supposedly removed from the game for being too difficult. Create subtle evidence: a glitched loading screen that briefly shows "51/50," a developer "accidentally" mentioning it, an empty space in the stage select UI. Never confirm or deny. | Manufactured mystery drives organic discussion and investigation. The Roblox community loves creepypasta-adjacent lore (Doors, Apeirophobia precedent). The "removed content" narrative creates FOMO and gives content creators investigation videos to make. Costs nothing but restraint. | Low | Month 3-6 |
| 8 | **"Void Walker" Identity Cult** | Create a secret Discord role called "Void Walker" awarded to the first 100 players who complete all 50 stages with 3 stars using only the base pencil material (no upgrades). The role grants access to a private channel that is completely empty --- no messages, no pins, nothing. Let the mystique build. | Exclusivity creates desire. The empty channel is a deliberate anti-climax that becomes its own meme ("I finally got Void Walker and there's NOTHING there"). The challenge requirement is brutally difficult, making the achievement genuinely impressive. The community will mythologize the role. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 9 | **"Draw to Escape vs. Real Architects" Stunt** | Partner with architecture students or a popular architecture YouTube channel. Give them Draw to Escape and have them apply real structural engineering principles to solve stages. Film their reactions when their "perfect" designs fail due to game physics and when absurd scribbles somehow work. | The contrast between professional training and chaotic game physics is inherently funny. Architecture and engineering content has a large audience on YouTube (Practical Engineering, Real Engineering). The "expert plays a game" format reliably gets millions of views. | Medium | Month 1-2 |
| 10 | **"The One-Star Campaign"** | Create a series of intentionally sarcastic, ironic one-star "reviews" as social media posts: "1 star --- my beautiful drawing of a horse turned into a 3D abomination that somehow solved the puzzle. Worst day of my life." "1 star --- I spent 20 minutes on a perfect bridge and my friend beat the stage with a single line." Post as fake testimonials with screenshots. | Ironic negative reviews are an established meme format (Amazon reviews, app store reviews). They communicate the game's best qualities through comedy. The format is inherently shareable and invites the audience to create their own fake reviews. Anti-marketing that is actually marketing. | Low | Pre-Launch, Ongoing |

---

### 8.2 Creator Campaign Formats

Structured content formats designed to be handed to creators as ready-to-film concepts. Each format exploits the drawing mechanic's natural content potential.

| # | Idea | Description | Why It Works | Effort | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **"Worst Artist Wins"** | Creator format where the goal is inverted: the worst, ugliest, most incompetent drawing that still solves the stage wins. Two or more creators compete. Judged on a combination of ugliness and functionality. | Skill inversion is comedy gold. Removes the intimidation of "I can't draw" by making bad art the objective. The format produces the game's most shareable content: hideous drawings that defy physics to somehow work. Accessible to creators of all skill levels. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 12 | **"Draw My Solution" Audience Submissions** | Viewers submit drawings via Discord or social media. The creator must attempt to use those exact viewer-submitted drawings to solve stages. No modifications allowed --- if the audience drew a stick figure on a unicycle, that is what gets materialized. | Audience participation drives engagement metrics (comments, submissions, return viewership). The creator loses control, producing genuine surprise and comedy. Viewers tune in to see if their drawing gets used. Creates a feedback loop between community and content. | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 13 | **"Blind Draw Duo"** | Two-creator format: Creator A sees the stage but cannot draw. Creator B has the drawing canvas but cannot see the stage. Creator A must verbally describe the obstacle while Creator B draws blind. The resulting drawing is what they must use. | Communication failure is universally funny. The format produces absurd drawings from miscommunication ("I said a RAMP not a LAMP"). Works especially well for creator duos and friendship dynamics. Naturally produces clips for TikTok highlights. | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 14 | **"The Art School Gauntlet"** | Professional artists (art school students, digital illustrators, art TikTokers) compete against experienced gamers. Artists draw beautifully but lack gaming instincts. Gamers draw terribly but understand physics. Who wins? | The skill mismatch creates a compelling narrative. Beautiful drawings that fail vs. ugly drawings that work perfectly inverts expectations. Bridges the art community and gaming community audiences. The crossover brings new viewers to both creators. | Medium | Month 1-2 |
| 15 | **"Speed Draw Speedrun"** | Speedrun format where the optimization target is drawing speed, not movement speed. How fast can you sketch the minimum viable drawing for each stage? Time starts when the canvas opens, stops when the stage is complete. Leaderboard tracked on Discord. | Speedrunning is an evergreen content format. Optimizing drawing speed adds a unique twist no other game offers. The "minimum viable drawing" concept reveals the game's depth --- the fastest solution to each stage becomes a community knowledge base. | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 16 | **"Jumpscare Roulette" Reaction Compilation** | Provide creators with a standardized format: play 10 random stages, face cam required, compile the jumpscare death moments into a rapid-fire reaction montage. Encourage side-by-side creator compilations (4 creators, same stage, 4 different reactions). | Jumpscare reactions are TikTok's highest-engagement content format. The standardized format means dozens of creators produce interchangeable clips that can be stitched, dueted, and compiled. The 4-way split screen is inherently viral. Low production barrier for any creator. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 17 | **"The Collab Ladder"** | 50 creators, 1 stage each, relay format. Creator 1 solves Stage 1 and passes to Creator 2 for Stage 2. Each creator's video links to the next. The chain must be completed within 48 hours. If a creator fails their stage within a time limit, the chain breaks and restarts from that creator. | Creates a coordinated content event that is bigger than any single creator. The relay format drives viewers across 50 different channels. The "chain break" stakes create genuine tension. Logistics are complex but the payoff is a multi-day cross-platform event. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 18 | **"Draw It Live" (Twitch Chat Decides)** | Twitch format where chat votes on what the streamer must draw for each stage. Streamer presents 3 options (e.g., "bridge," "catapult," "a horse"), chat votes via poll, streamer must draw and use the winning option regardless of viability. | Interactive streaming drives engagement metrics. Chat investment in the outcome increases watch time. The constraint of drawing what chat demands produces chaos and comedy. Works for any Twitch streamer, not just gaming channels. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 19 | **"The Mirror Match"** | Two creators play the same stage simultaneously, split-screen, no communication. After both solve it, reveal the other's solution. The contrast between two independent approaches to the same problem is the content. | Side-by-side comparison is one of the most reliable content formats on YouTube and TikTok. The drawing mechanic guarantees the solutions will be different. The reveal moment ("you drew WHAT?") is a natural highlight clip. Infinitely repeatable across stages. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 20 | **"The Inheritance Run"** | Creator A plays Stages 1-25, drawing their solutions. Creator B then plays Stages 1-25 but must use Creator A's leftover drawings (they cannot erase or redraw, only add to what Creator A left behind). The accumulated mess of two people's drawings creates escalating chaos. | The "inherited mess" format escalates naturally --- by Stage 20, the canvas is an incomprehensible collage of two people's drawings. The comedy compounds. Works as a multi-part series. Creates natural back-and-forth between two creators' audiences. | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |

---

### 8.3 In-Game Social Features (Build These Into the Game)

These are features that should be engineered into the game itself. They turn every player into a marketing channel by making sharing, competition, and community participation native to the experience.

| # | Idea | Description | Why It Works | Effort | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | **"The Hall of Fame Canvas"** | A rotating in-game gallery where the top-voted community drawings from each week are displayed as 3D sculptures in a dedicated lobby area. Players can walk through and inspect the sculptures. Voting happens via an in-game terminal and Discord integration. | Gives players a tangible goal beyond completion. Being featured in the Hall of Fame is social currency. The gallery itself is content --- players screenshot and share their featured drawings. Creates a reason to visit the game even without playing stages. | High | Month 1-2 |
| 22 | **"Drawing Duel" Mode** | Head-to-head competitive mode: 2 players, same stage, 10-second drawing window, split-screen race. Both players draw simultaneously, then watch their drawings materialize and race to the finish. First to complete the stage wins. Best of 5 stages determines the match. | Competitive modes drive retention and content creation. The 10-second drawing window forces snap decisions, producing messy, funny drawings under pressure. Split-screen races are inherently watchable. Ties directly into the Versus Mode update (Month 4). | High | Month 3-6 |
| 23 | **"Ghost Library"** | Save a replay ghost of every successful stage completion. Any player can race against any other player's ghost on any stage. Searchable by player name, completion time, or star rating. See exactly how someone else solved it, then try to beat their approach. | Asynchronous multiplayer without the infrastructure cost of real-time servers. Creates infinite replayability --- every completion by any player adds content. The "race against your friend's ghost" mechanic drives organic invites. Speedrunners gain a built-in comparison tool. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 24 | **"The Shame Wall"** | A public in-game gallery of the most spectacular deaths from the past 24 hours. Players can vote: "L Drawing" or "Skill Issue." The highest-voted deaths get featured on a giant screen in the lobby. Opt-in only (players choose to submit their death replay). | Failure content is more engaging than success content. The voting mechanic creates community interaction. Being featured on the Shame Wall becomes a desirable outcome (players will intentionally create spectacular failures). The "L Drawing vs. Skill Issue" framing becomes a community catchphrase. | Medium | Month 1-2 |
| 25 | **"Star Rating Flex Cards"** | After completing a stage with 3 stars, generate a shareable card showing: the player's drawing, their completion time, star rating, material used, and a comparison to the global average. One-tap share to Roblox feed, Discord, or download as image. Styled as a premium achievement card with holographic effects. | Every 3-star completion becomes a shareable marketing asset. The global comparison ("faster than 94% of players") triggers competitive sharing. The holographic card aesthetic appeals to the collection/flex culture of the target demographic. Zero marginal cost per share. | Medium | Launch |
| 26 | **"Collab Canvas" Co-op Mode** | Two-player cooperative mode where each player draws on one half of the canvas and cannot see the other half. Their drawings must connect in the middle to form a functional solution. Requires communication but prevents copying. | Forces genuine collaboration and communication. The "blind merge" in the middle produces comedy when drawings do not align. Creates natural content moments for duos. Differentiates from standard co-op by adding a unique creative constraint. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 27 | **"My Drawing vs. My Friend's Drawing" Challenge System** | After completing a stage, one-tap invite a friend to attempt the same stage. When both have completed it, show a side-by-side comparison of their drawings with a community vote: "Whose drawing was better?" Results tracked on a friendship rivalry leaderboard. | Direct friend-to-friend invites are the highest-conversion acquisition channel in Roblox. The comparison format drives competitive replay. The rivalry leaderboard creates ongoing engagement between friend pairs. Every challenge sent is a potential new player acquired. | Medium | Month 1-2 |
| 28 | **"Speedrun Sunday" Weekly Event** | Every Sunday, a single designated stage becomes the weekly speedrun target. A live in-game leaderboard tracks the fastest completions in real time. Top 10 at the end of Sunday earn an exclusive weekly cosmetic (trail effect, pencil skin) that rotates each week. | Weekly recurring events create habitual return behavior. The live leaderboard creates urgency and competition. Exclusive rotating cosmetics drive FOMO. The single-stage focus makes participation accessible (you do not need to be a full-game speedrunner). Content creators cover the weekly stage. | Medium | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 29 | **"The Void Cinematic"** | When a player dies in the Void zone (the death zone below stages), trigger a slow-motion dramatic replay of their final moments: the drawing failing, the character falling, a cinematic camera angle, dramatic music. Auto-saves as a 5-second clip. One-tap share. | Transforms the most frustrating moment (dying) into the most cinematic moment. Slow-motion failure replays are inherently shareable. The dramatic framing elevates a death from annoying to epic. Players will seek out dramatic deaths just to generate cool clips. | Medium | Month 1-2 |
| 30 | **Annual World Championship** | A bracket-style tournament held annually with secret, never-before-seen stages designed specifically for competition. Qualifiers run in-game over 2 weeks. Finals are livestreamed with commentary. Winner receives a unique one-of-a-kind in-game item and permanent Hall of Fame placement. | Tournaments create aspirational content and community milestones. Secret stages prevent practice advantages, leveling the playing field. The livestreamed finals become a major content event. Annual cadence creates tradition and long-term community investment. | High | Month 3-6 (announce), Year 1 (execute) |

### 8.4 Meme Infrastructure (Engineer These Cultural Moments)

These are not individual marketing tactics --- they are cultural seeds designed to grow into organic, self-sustaining memes and community language. The goal is to give the community the raw materials to create culture around Draw to Escape without it feeling manufactured.

| # | Idea | Description | Why It Works | Effort | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 31 | **"THE VOID CLAIMS ALL" Catchphrase** | Establish "THE VOID CLAIMS ALL" as the universal response to any death in Draw to Escape. Seed it in the game's death screen text, Discord bot responses, official social media replies, and loading screen tips. Never explain it. Never force it. Let it propagate. | Catchphrases that emerge from games (GG, "the cake is a lie," "skill issue") become cultural identifiers. By seeding it in multiple touchpoints without explicitly promoting it, it feels organic. Players will use it outside the game as a general-purpose reaction to failure. | Low | Pre-Launch, Ongoing |
| 32 | **"DRAW BETTER" Two-Word Callout** | The two-word response to any complaint, any failure, any frustration. Embed it as a loading screen tip, a Discord bot command (!drawbetter), and an in-game taunt emote. The phrase is dismissive, funny, and immediately associated with Draw to Escape. | Short, punchy phrases are the most viral meme format. "DRAW BETTER" works as a response to virtually any situation (in-game or real life). It is the Draw to Escape equivalent of "git gud" but more specific and more brandable. Two words, zero ambiguity, infinite applications. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 33 | **"Physics Said Yes / Physics Said No" Reaction Format** | Create a template for the "Physics Said Yes" (drawing works against all odds) and "Physics Said No" (drawing fails despite looking perfect) reaction format. Post official examples. Encourage creators to use the format. Provide a clean template image. | Binary reaction formats are TikTok's most successful meme architecture. The physics engine's unpredictability guarantees a steady supply of both outcomes. Every player will experience both within minutes. The format is reusable across any game or real-life physics scenario, expanding reach beyond the game. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 34 | **"The Cliff" Impossibility Discourse** | Identify the single hardest stage in the game (likely in Zone 9) and manufacture discourse around its impossibility. Post a "Day 1 of trying to beat The Cliff" series on TikTok. Let the community develop theories, strategies, and mythology around it. Never make it easier. | Difficulty discourse drove Elden Ring, Celeste, and Getting Over It into cultural relevance. A single stage that becomes infamous creates a shared reference point for the entire community. "Have you beaten The Cliff?" becomes a status symbol. The "Day X" format is an established TikTok series structure. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 35 | **"What Zone Are You?" Personality Quiz** | Create a "What Zone Are You?" personality quiz for social media: "Are you a Pencil Plains (methodical), Crayon Canyon (chaotic), Neon City (creative), or The Void (destructive)?" Use the game's 10 zones as personality archetypes. Shareable result cards. | Personality quizzes are among the most shared content formats on social media (BuzzFeed proved this at scale). Zone-as-identity creates community segmentation that players self-select into. "I'm a Neon City" becomes identity shorthand. Drives awareness of the zone system. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 36 | **"Neon Bridge to Nowhere" Cursed Aesthetic** | Curate and amplify the specific aesthetic of beautiful, detailed neon drawings that fail spectacularly. Frame it as "cursed art" --- gorgeous drawings that are completely non-functional. Create a dedicated social media highlight series. The beauty-failure contrast is the meme. | The juxtaposition of effort and failure is universally relatable comedy. "Neon Bridge to Nowhere" becomes a metaphor for beautiful but useless effort. The aesthetic is genuinely striking and screenshot-worthy. Players will intentionally create beautiful failures to be featured. | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 37 | **"Balloon Escape Artist" Cheese Meta** | When players discover unintended solutions (exploits, physics cheese, drawing a balloon to float over everything), do not patch them immediately. Instead, amplify the "cheese meta" discourse. Let the community debate whether cheese solutions are legitimate. Name the strategies. Celebrate the creativity. | Exploit discourse drives engagement. "Is it cheating or is it creative?" is an inherently engaging debate. Named strategies ("the balloon method," "the wall clip") create community vocabulary. Patching exploits kills content; celebrating them creates it. The drawing mechanic means every exploit is a creative expression. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 38 | **"Descent Into Madness" Stage-by-Stage Content Format** | Create a standardized content format: a creator plays stages 1 through 50 in order, and the video is edited to show their progressive mental deterioration. Stage 1: calm, confident. Stage 25: frustrated. Stage 40: unhinged. Stage 50: transcendent. Provide creators with the format template. | The "descent into madness" narrative arc is a proven YouTube format (Getting Over It, Jump King, Geometry Dash). The 50-stage structure provides a natural difficulty progression that maps perfectly to the emotional arc. Each creator's version is unique because their drawings are unique. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |
| 39 | **"Art Teacher Parody" Series** | Create a social media series where a character roleplays as a pretentious art teacher critiquing players' in-game drawings with absurd seriousness. "The use of negative space in this bridge suggests a deep anxiety about structural permanence." "This circle --- and I use the term loosely --- represents the futility of geometric precision." | Art criticism parody is an established comedy format with cross-demographic appeal. The contrast between pretentious analysis and terrible game drawings is inherently funny. The format is infinitely repeatable and can be handed to any comedy creator. Reaches art and comedy audiences beyond gaming. | Low | Month 1-2, Ongoing |
| 40 | **Jumpscare Screenshot as Reaction Image** | Capture the single most extreme jumpscare frame from the death animations and establish it as a reaction image. Post it in response to unexpected or shocking content. Seed it on Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. The image should be recognizable at thumbnail size. | Reaction images are the atomic unit of internet culture. A single iconic frame that represents "shock" or "surprise" becomes synonymous with the game. Every use is a micro-advertisement. The jumpscare aesthetic is distinctive enough to be immediately attributable to Draw to Escape. | Low | Launch, Ongoing |

### 8.5 Cross-Platform Stunts & Partnerships

High-visibility events and partnerships that bridge Draw to Escape from Roblox into the physical world, mainstream media, and adjacent industries. These are bigger swings with bigger payoffs.

| # | Idea | Description | Why It Works | Effort | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 41 | **"Draw It Real" 3D Print Pipeline** | Partner with a 3D printing service. The winning drawing from each weekly "Worst Drawing Wins" contest gets 3D printed as a physical object and mailed to the creator. Film the unboxing. The physical manifestation of a terrible in-game drawing is the content. | Bridging digital to physical creates premium content moments. The 3D printed object is a tangible trophy that players will display and photograph. Unboxing content performs well on YouTube and TikTok. The absurdity of a terrible drawing as a real object is inherently shareable. Cost per print is 10-30 USD. | Medium | Month 3-6, Ongoing |
| 42 | **"The Impossible Classroom" School Partnership** | Develop a STEAM educator mode: simplified stages focused on physics and engineering concepts, teacher dashboard with class leaderboards, curriculum-aligned lesson plans. Partner with 2-3 schools for a pilot program. Students solve stages as classwork. | Education partnerships create institutional distribution (schools adopt it, hundreds of students onboard at once). Parents view the game positively. Media coverage of "game used in classrooms" is earned PR. The STEAM angle is genuine --- the drawing-to-physics mechanic teaches spatial reasoning and structural engineering. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 43 | **"The World Record Canvas" Guinness Attempt** | Organize a community event to set a Guinness World Record for "largest collaborative drawing in a video game." Thousands of players contribute to a single massive canvas over 24 hours. The final drawing is displayed in-game permanently. Document the attempt for a YouTube video. | Guinness attempts generate mainstream media coverage. The communal goal unites the player base around a single event. The resulting video has broad appeal beyond the gaming audience. "Guinness World Record" in the title guarantees click-through. The permanent in-game display rewards participation. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 44 | **"Escape Room IRL" Convention Pop-Up** | Build a physical pop-up at a gaming convention (RDC, TwitchCon, PAX). Attendees draw on a physical tablet, a backstage prop artist rapidly builds their drawing out of foam/cardboard in real time, and the physical creation is revealed on stage. Combines the game's mechanic with live spectacle. | Physical activations at conventions create earned media, influencer content, and social media moments. The live prop artist adds theatrical spectacle. The "your drawing becomes real" moment mirrors the game's core mechanic in a way that is immediately comprehensible to non-players. High foot traffic, high impressions. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 45 | **Art Supply Brand Partnership (Crayola)** | Partner with Crayola (or similar art supply brand) for a co-branded material pack: 9 in-game materials themed after real art supplies (crayon, marker, colored pencil, watercolor, chalk, oil pastel, charcoal, gel pen, highlighter). Include a physical Draw to Escape activity booklet in Crayola product packaging. | Crayola reaches the exact demographic (ages 6-14). Co-branding is credible because the game is literally about drawing. Physical product packaging reaches non-digital audiences. The 9-material pack maps perfectly to the game's material system. Revenue share potential on both the in-game pack and physical product. | High | Month 3-6 |
| 46 | **"Draw to Donate" Charity Livestream** | 50 creators, 50 hours, continuous livestream relay. Every death triggers a donation to a children's art education charity. Death counter displayed on screen. Goal: reach a community-set donation target. The more players die, the more money is raised. | Charity events generate positive press coverage and community goodwill. The "deaths = donations" mechanic turns failure into a positive outcome, changing the emotional relationship with dying. 50 creators means 50 audiences are exposed. The 50-hour marathon creates ongoing appointment viewing. | Medium | Month 3-6 |
| 47 | **"The Void Exhibition" Museum/Gallery Installation** | Partner with a local gallery or museum to create an exhibition of Draw to Escape's most iconic player drawings, rendered as large-format prints or physical sculptures. Interactive station lets visitors play the game. Opening night event with creators and press. | Gallery exhibitions create cultural legitimacy ("games as art" narrative). Earned media coverage in art and culture publications reaches audiences outside gaming. The interactive station converts gallery visitors into players. The exhibition assets become permanent marketing collateral (photos, video). | High | Month 3-6 |
| 48 | **"Sketch to Script" Open-Source Release** | Open-source the 2D-to-3D materialization system on GitHub. Publish a technical blog post explaining the procedural generation pipeline. Let other developers integrate the drawing mechanic into their own games. Include "Powered by Draw to Escape Technology" branding. | Open-source releases generate developer community goodwill, tech press coverage, and Hacker News/Reddit attention. Other games using the technology create permanent brand awareness. The technical blog post positions the studio as innovators. Developer audiences are high-influence and share widely. | Medium | Month 3-6 |
| 49 | **"The Imagination Index" Annual Data Report** | At the end of Year 1, publish a beautifully designed data report: "What Humanity Draws When Given a Physics Puzzle." Analyze millions of player drawings to reveal patterns: most common shapes, most creative solutions per stage, how drawing behavior changes with difficulty, cultural differences in drawing approach. | Data reports are linkable, shareable, and quotable by media outlets. "What 10 million players drew" is a genuinely interesting dataset. The report positions Draw to Escape as a cultural artifact, not just a game. Annual publication creates a recurring media moment. The data itself is fascinating and unique to this game. | Medium | Year 1 |
| 50 | **"Zone Zero" Projection Mapping Launch Event** | For the game's launch or a major milestone, project Draw to Escape gameplay onto a building facade in a major city. Attendees can draw on tablets and watch their drawings appear on the building in real time, materialized as projected 3D objects. Film everything for a launch trailer. | Projection mapping creates spectacle content that performs on every social media platform. The "draw on a tablet, see it on a building" moment is awe-inspiring and immediately communicates the game's core mechanic at massive scale. The resulting video content has viral potential independent of gaming audiences. | High | Launch or Month 3-6 |

| 50 | "Zone Zero" Projection Mapping Event | Cross-Platform Stunts | High | High | Launch or Month 3-6 | **Low** |

**How to read this matrix:**
- **High priority** items are low-to-medium effort with high impact. Execute these first --- most can be started before or at launch with minimal resources.
- **Medium priority** items are either medium effort with medium-high impact, or require specific timing windows. Schedule these into the Month 1-3 roadmap.
- **Low priority** items are high effort regardless of impact. These are stretch goals that become viable once the game has proven traction and the team has bandwidth or budget. Do not attempt these until the High and Medium tiers are executing well.

**Sequencing guidance:** Start with the meme infrastructure (items 31-34, 40) and creator formats (items 11, 16, 19) pre-launch and at launch --- these are zero-cost seeds that compound over time. Layer in the in-game social features (items 4, 25, 27, 28) in the first 1-2 months. Scale to cross-platform stunts (items 41, 46, 48) in Month 3-6 only after confirming organic growth and community engagement metrics.

| **Obby Creator** | 25M+ | User-generated content, massive stage library, community creation tools | Higher-quality curated stages, the drawing mechanic is a fundamentally different interaction (creating vs. platforming), physics simulation adds emergent gameplay |
| **Free Draw** | 15M+ | Pure creative expression, social drawing, large art community | Adds purpose to drawing (puzzle solving), physics simulation makes drawings functional not just decorative, progression system provides goals |
| **Build a Boat for Treasure** | 40M+ | Building + physics, creative freedom, social, frequent updates | Drawing is faster and more accessible than block-by-block building, 2D-to-3D materialization is more visually satisfying, structured puzzle design provides clearer objectives |
| **Mega Obby** | 20M+ | Massive stage count, accessible difficulty, progression satisfaction | Drawing mechanic differentiates every attempt, materials add strategic depth, jumpscare deaths add entertainment value to failure |
| **Escape Room** | 10M+ | Puzzle solving, logic challenges, cooperative play | Drawing adds physical creativity to logic puzzles, 50-stage structure provides longer progression, physics-based solutions allow multiple valid answers per puzzle |

**Positioning statement:** Draw to Escape is the first Roblox experience that combines obstacle course progression with freeform drawing and real-time physics materialization. It is not a traditional obby where you jump on preset platforms. It is not a drawing game where you create art with no purpose. It is a puzzle game where your creativity is the solution. Draw anything. Watch it come to life. Solve 50 stages across 10 themed zones. Every player's answer is different. What will you draw?
